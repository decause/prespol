<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:53px; top:2431px; width:207px; height:431px;"><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">The 2012 Republican Platform is a statement of
<br>who we are and what we believe as a Party and our
<br>vision for a stronger and freer America.  
<br>The pursuit of opportunity has defined America
<br>from our very beginning.  This is a land of opportu-
<br>nity. The American Dream  is  a  dream  of  equal  op-
<br>portunity  for  all.  And  the  Republican  Party  is  the
<br>party of opportunity.
<br>Today, that American Dream is at risk.
<br>Our  nation  faces  unprecedented  uncertainty
<br>with great fiscal and economic challenges, and under
<br>the current Administration has suffered through the
<br>longest  and most  severe  economic  downturn  since
<br>the Great Depression. 
<br>Many Americans  have  experienced  the  burden
<br>of lost jobs, lost homes, and lost hopes.  Our middle
<br>class has  felt  that burden most acutely. Meanwhile,
<br>the  federal  government  has  expanded  its  size  and
<br>scope,  its  borrowing  and  spending,  its  debt  and
<br>deficit. Federalism is threatened and liberty retreats.
<br>For  the world,  this  has  been  four  years  of  lost
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">American leadership, leadership that depends upon
<br>economic vitality and peace through strength. 
<br>Put simply: The times call for trustworthy lead-
<br>ership and honest talk about the challenges we face.
<br>Our nation and our people cannot afford  the  status
<br>quo. We must begin anew, with profound changes in
<br>the  way  government  operates;  the  way  it  budgets,
<br>taxes, and regulates. Jefferson’s vision of a “wise and
<br>frugal government” must be restored.  
<br>Providence  has  put  us  at  the  fork  in  the  road,
<br>and we must answer the question: If not us, who?  If
<br>not now, when? 
<br>That  is  the  choice  facing  the American  people
<br>this November. Every voter will be asked  to  choose
<br>between  the  chronic  high  unemployment  and  the
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:278px; top:2431px; width:207px; height:431px;"><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">unsustainable  debt  produced  by  a  big  government
<br>entitlement society, or a positive, optimistic view of
<br>an  opportunity  society,  where  any  American  who
<br>works  hard,  dreams  big  and  follows  the  rules  can
<br>achieve anything he or she wants.   
<br>The  American  people  possess  vast  reserves  of
<br>courage and determination and the capacity to hear
<br>the  truth  and  chart  a  strong  course. They  are  eager
<br>for  the opportunity  to  take on  life’s  challenges and,
<br>through  faith  and  hard work,  transform  the  future
<br>for the better.  They are the most generous people on
<br>earth,  giving  sacrificially  of  their  time,  talent,  and
<br>treasure. 
<br>This  platform  affirms  that America  has  always
<br>been a place of grand dreams and  even grander  re-
<br>alities;  and  so  it will  be  again,  if we  return  govern-
<br>ment  to  its  proper  role,  making  it  smaller  and
<br>smarter. If we restructure government’s most impor-
<br>tant domestic programs to avoid their fiscal collapse.
<br>If  we  keep  taxation,  litigation,  and  regulation  to  a
<br>minimum. If we celebrate success, entrepreneurship,
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">and  innovation.  If we  lift up  the middle  class.  If we
<br>hand over to the next generation a legacy of growth
<br>and prosperity, rather than entitlements and indebt-
<br>edness. 
<br>That  same  commitment must  be  present  both
<br>here at home and abroad. We are a party that knows
<br>the  difference  between  international  acclaim  and
<br>world  leadership. We will  lift  the  torch  of  freedom
<br>and  democracy  to  inspire  all  those  who  would  be
<br>free.   As President Reagan  issued the clarion call to
<br>“tear  down  this  Wall,”  so  must  we  always  stand
<br>against tyranny and oppression. We will always sup-
<br>port  and  cherish  our  men  and  women  in  uniform
<br>who defend our liberties with their lives.
<br>As we embark upon this critical mission, we are

<br>of the governed.  
<br>The  principles written  in  the  Constitution  are
<br>secured  by  the  character  of  the  American  people.
<br>President George Washington said in his first inau-
<br>gural address: “The propitious smiles of Heaven can
<br>never  be  expected  on  a  nation  that  disregards  the
<br>eternal rules of order and right which Heaven  itself

<br>Mitt Romney  and Paul Ryan  understand  these
<br>great  truths.  They  share  a  positive  vision  for
<br>America – a vision of America renewed and strong.
<br>They  know  America’s  best  days  lay  ahead.    It  will
<br>take honest results-oriented, conservative leadership
<br>to  enact  good  policies  for  our  people.  They  will
<br>provide it.
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">We  respectfully  submit  this  platform  to  the
<br>American people. It is both a vision of where we are
<br>headed and an  invitation  to  join us  in  that  journey.
<br>It  is  about  the  great dreams  and  opportunities  that
<br>have  always  been  America  and  must  remain  the
<br>essence of America for generations to come. 
<br>May  God  continue  to  shed  his  grace  on  the
<br>United States of America.

<br>investment by individual Americans, but it is not an
<br>end in itself. Prosperity provides the means by which
<br>individuals  and  families  can  maintain  their  inde-
<br>pendence  from  government,  raise  their  children  by
<br>their  own  values,  practice  their  faith,  and  build
<br>communities  of  self-reliant  neighbors.  It  is  also  the
<br>means  by  which  the United  States  is  able  to  assert
<br>global  leadership. The  vigor  of  our  economy makes
<br>possible  our military  strength  and  is  critical  to  our
<br>national security. 
<br>This  year’s  election  is  a  chance  to  restore  the
<br>proven values of the American free enterprise system.
<br>We offer our Republican vision of a free people using
<br>their God-given  talents,  combined with  hard work,
<br>self-reliance, ethical conduct, and  the pursuit of op-
<br>portunity, to achieve great things for themselves and
<br>the greater community.  Our vision of an opportunity
<br>society stands in stark contrast to the current Admin-
<br>istration’s  policies  that  expand  entitlements  and
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">guarantees, create new public programs, and provide
<br>expensive  government  bailouts. That  road  has  cre-
<br>ated  a  culture  of  dependency,  bloated  government,
<br>and massive debt. 
<br>Republicans  believe  in  the  Great  American
<br>Dream,  with  its  economics  of  inclusion,  enabling
<br>everyone to have a chance to own, invest, build, and
<br>prosper.  It  is  the  opposite  of  the  policies which,  for
<br>the  last  three  and  a  half  years,  have  stifled  growth,
<br>destroyed  jobs, halted  investment, created unprece-
<br>dented  uncertainty,  and  prolonged  the  worst  eco-
<br>nomic downturn since the Great Depression.  Those
<br>policies  have  placed  the  federal  government  in  the
<br>driver’s seat, rather than relying on energetic and en-
<br>trepreneurial Americans to rebuild the economy from
<br>the ground up. Excessive taxation and regulation im-
<br>pede  economic  development.  Lowering  taxes  pro-

<br>Congress  will  jumpstart  an  economic  renewal  that
<br>creates  opportunity,  rewards work  and  saving,  and
<br>unleashes the productive genius of the American peo-
<br>ple.  Because the GOP is the Great Opportunity Party,
<br>this  is  our  pledge  to workers without  jobs,  families
<br>without  savings,  and  neighborhoods without  hope:
<br>together we  can  get  our  country  back  on  track,  ex-

<br>age of subsidies and spending to create temporary or
<br>artificial  jobs.  We  want  much  more  than  that.  We
<br>want  a  roaring  job market  to match  a  roaring  econ-

<br>reined  in. American  companies must  be more  com-
<br>petitive in the world market, and we must be aggres-
<br>sive in promoting U.S. products abroad and securing

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">of  the  U.S.  economy,  employing  tens  of  millions
<br>of  workers.  Small  businesses  create  the  vast

<br>to generate enough capital to grow and create jobs for

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">Taxes,  by  their  very  nature,  reduce  a  citizen’s
<br>freedom. Their proper role in a free society should be
<br>to fund services that are essential and authorized by
<br>the Constitution,  such  as  national  security,  and  the

<br>unnecessary  or  ineffective  programs,  or  foster  the
<br>crony  capitalism  that  corrupts  both  politicians  and
<br>corporations.  
<br>Our goal is a tax system that is simple, transpar-
<br>ent, flatter, and fair.  In contrast, the current IRS code
<br>is like a patchwork quilt, stitched together over time

<br>and innovation, increase American competitiveness,
<br>and recognize the burdens on families with children.
<br>To that end, we propose to:
<br>Extend  the  2001  and  2003  tax  relief
<br>packages—commonly  known  as  the  Bush  tax
<br>cuts—pending    reform  of  the  tax  code,  to  keep

<br>Reform  the  tax  code  by  reducing marginal
<br>tax  rates  by  20  percent  across-the-board  in  a
<br>revenue-neutral manner;
<br>Eliminate  the  taxes  on  interest,  dividends,
<br>and  capital  gains  altogether  for  lower  and
<br>middle-income taxpayers;
<br>End the Death Tax; and

<br>Balancing the Budget, and Ensuring 
<br>Sound Monetary Policy
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">The massive  federal  government  is  structurally
<br>and  financially  broken.  For  decades  it  has  been
<br>pushed beyond its core functions, increasing spend-
<br>ing  to  unsustainable  levels.  Elected  officials  have
<br>overpromised  and  overspent,  and  now  the  bills  are
<br>due.  Unless  we  take  dramatic  action  now,  young
<br>Americans and their children will inherit an unprece-
<br>dented  legacy  of  enormous  and  unsustainable  debt,
<br>with the interest alone consuming an ever-increasing
<br>portion  of  the  country’s  wealth.
<br>The  specter  of  national  bank-
<br>ruptcy that now hangs over much
<br>of  Europe  is  a  warning  to  us  as
<br>well.  Over  the  last  three  and  a
<br>half  years, while  cutting  the  de-
<br>fense budget, the current Admin-
<br>istration has added an additional
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">$5.3  trillion  to  the  national
<br>debt—now  approximately  $16
<br>trillion,  the  largest  amount  in
<br>U.S.  history.  In  fiscal  year  2011,
<br>spending  reached  $3.6  trillion,
<br>nearly a quarter of our gross do-
<br>mestic  product. Adjusted  for  in-
<br>flation,  that’s  more  than  three
<br>times its peak level in World War II, and almost half
<br>of  every  dollar  spent  was  borrowed  money.  Three
<br>programs—Medicare,  Medicaid,  and  Social  Secu-
<br>rity— account  for over 40 percent of  total spending.
<br>While  these  levels  of  spending  and  debt  are  already
<br>harming  job  creation  and  growth, projections  of  fu-
<br>ture  spending  growth  are  nothing  short  of  cata-
<br>strophic,  both  economically  and  socially. And  those
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">dire  projections  do  not  include  the  fiscal  nightmare

<br>will propose immediate reductions in federal spend-
<br>ing,  as  a  down  payment  on  the much  larger  task  of
<br>long-range fiscal control.  We suggest a tripartite test
<br>for every federal activity. First, is it within the consti-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">tutional scope of the federal government? Second, is
<br>it effective and absolutely necessary? And third, is it
<br>sufficiently important to justify borrowing, especially
<br>foreign  borrowing,  to  fund  it?  Against  those  stan-
<br>dards we will measure programs  from  international
<br>population control to California’s federally subsidized
<br>high-speed  train  to  nowhere,  and  terminate  pro-
<br>grams that don’t measure up.

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">Cutting  spending  is  not  enough;  it must  be  ac-

<br>productivity,  use  of  technology,  and  long-term  gov-

<br>deficits  and  ignite  economic
<br>growth. We must restructure the
<br>twentieth  century  entitlement
<br>state  so  the  missions  of  impor-
<br>tant programs can succeed in the
<br>twenty-first  century.  Medicare,
<br>in particular, is the largest driver
<br>of  future  debt.  Our  reform  of
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">healthcare  will  empower  mil-

<br>personal  healthcare  decisions,
<br>unlike Obamacare  that  empow-
<br>ered a handful of bureaucrats to
<br>cut  Medicare  in  ways  that  will
<br>deny care for the elderly.
<br>We  must  also  change  the
<br>budget process itself.  From its beginning, its design
<br>has enabled, rather than restrained, reckless spend-
<br>ing  by  giving  procedural  cover  to Members  of Con-

<br>“tax expenditure,” which means that any earnings the

<br>spending the same amount on some program. It also

<br>Republican Members  of Congress  have  repeat-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">edly  tried  to  reform  the  budget  process  to  make  it

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">A sound monetary policy is critical for maintain-
<br>ing a strong economy.  Inflation diminishes  the pur-
<br>chasing power of the dollar at home and abroad and
<br>is  a  hidden  tax  on  the American  people. Moreover,
<br>the  inflation  tax  is  regressive,  punishes  those  who
<br>save,  transfers  wealth  from  Main  Street  to  Wall
<br>Street,  and  has  grave  implications  for  seniors  living
<br>on fixed incomes. 
<br>Because  the  Federal Reserve’s monetary  policy
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">actions  affect  both  inflation  and  economic  activity,
<br>those  actions  should  be  transparent.  Moreover,
<br>the  Fed’s  important  role  as  a  lender  of  last  resort
<br>should  also  be  carried  out  in  a  more  transparent
<br>manner. A  free  society  demands  that  the  sun  shine
<br>on all elements of government. Therefore, the Repub-
<br>lican Party will work  to advance substantive  legisla-
<br>tion  that  brings  transparency  and  accountability  to
<br>the Federal Reserve, the Federal Open Market Com-
<br>mittee,  and  the  Fed’s  dealings  with  foreign  central
<br>banks.  The first step to increasing transparency and
<br>accountability  is  through  an  annual  audit  of  the
<br>Federal  Reserve’s  activities.    Such  an  audit  would
<br>need to be carefully implemented so that the Federal
<br>Reserve  remains  insulated  from  political  pressures
<br>and  so  its  decisions  are  based  on  sound  economic
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">principles and sound money rather than on political

<br>Determined  to  crush  the  double-digit  inflation
<br>that was part of the Carter Administration’s economic
<br>legacy, President Reagan, shortly after his inaugura-
<br>tion, established a commission to consider the feasi-
<br>bility  of  a  metallic  basis  for  U.S.  currency.  The
<br>commission advised against such a move. Now, three
<br>decades  later, as we  face  the  task of  cleaning up  the
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">wreckage of the current Administration’s policies, we
<br>propose a similar commission to investigate possible
<br>ways to set a fixed value for the dollar.

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">Homeownership  expands  personal 
<br>liberty,
<br>builds  communities,  and  helps  Americans  create
<br>wealth. “The American Dream” is not a stale slogan.
<br>It is the lived reality that expresses the aspirations of
<br>all our people. It means a decent place to live, a safe
<br>place to raise kids, a welcoming place to retire. It be-
<br>speaks  the  quiet  pride  of  those  who  work  hard  to
<br>shelter their family and, in the process, create caring
<br>neighborhoods. Homeownership  is  best  fostered  by
<br>a growing economy with low interest rates, as well as
<br>prudent regulation, financial education, and targeted
<br>assistance to responsible borrowers. 
<br>The collapse of the housing market over the last
<br>four years has been not only a severe blow to the en-
<br>tire economy, but also a personal tragedy to millions
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">of Americans whose homes have lost value and to so
<br>many  others who  have  lost  their  homes. Combined
<br>with high unemployment, that decline has left count-
<br>less homeowners saddled with mortgages exceeding
<br>the value of their homes. The response of the current
<br>Administration has done little to improve, and much
<br>to worsen, the situation. By discouraging private sec-
<br>tor  investment,  it  has  stalled  the  housing  recovery.
<br>Its massive intervention in the housing market, with
<br>the  Federal Housing Administration  (FHA),  Fannie
<br>Mae  and  Freddie Mac  backing  nearly  all  new mort-
<br>gages,  has  hit  the  taxpayers  with  a  bill  for  almost

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">We  must  establish  a  mortgage  finance  system
<br>based on competition and free enterprise that is trans-
<br>parent,  encourages  the  private  sector  to  return  to
<br>housing, and promotes personal responsibility on the
<br>part  of borrowers. Policies  that promote  reliance  on
<br>private  capital,  like private mortgage  insurance, will
<br>be critical to scaling back the federal role in the hous-
<br>ing market and avoiding future taxpayer bailouts. Re-
<br>forms should provide clear and prudent underwriting
<br>standards and guidelines on acceptable lending prac-
<br>tices. Compliance with  regulatory  standards  should
<br>provide  a  legal  safe  harbor  to  guard  against  oppor-
<br>tunistic litigation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were
<br>a primary cause of the housing crisis because their im-
<br>plicit  government  guarantee  allowed  them  to  avoid
<br>market discipline and make risky investments. Their
<br>favored  political  status  enriched  their  politically-
<br>connected executives and their shareholders at the ex-
<br>pense  of  the  nation.  Both  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie
<br>Mac  should  be wound  down  in  size  and  scope,  and
<br>their officials should be held to account.
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">The FHA, tripled in size to more than $1 trillion
<br>under  the  current Administration,  has  crowded  out
<br>the private sector and is at risk of requiring a taxpayer
<br>bailout. It must be downsized and limited to helping
<br>first-time  homebuyers  and  low-  and  moderate-
<br>income  borrowers.   Taxpayer  dollars  should  not  be
<br>used  to  bail  out  borrowers  and  lenders  by  funding
<br>principal write-downs. While the federal government
<br>must  prosecute mortgage  fraud  and  other  financial
<br>crimes,  any  settlements  received  thereby  should  be
<br>directed  to  individuals  harmed  by  the misconduct,
<br>not diverted to pay for unrelated programs.  
<br>FDIC insurance for bank depositors must be pre-
<br>served.  However, to correct for the moral hazard cre-
<br>ated  by  deposit  insurance,  banks  should  be  well
<br>capitalized, which is the best insurance against future

<br>percent  of  the  funds  went  to  transportation,  with
<br>most  of  that  to  cosmetic  “shovel-ready”  projects
<br>rather  than  fundamental  structural  improvements.
<br>All  the while,  the Democrats’ Davis-Bacon  law  con-
<br>tinues  to  drive  up  infrastructure  construction  and

<br>safety and availability of our water supply—is in per-
<br>ilous  condition.  Engineering  surveys  report  crum-

<br>economic  growth  and  job  creation.  In  the  last  two
<br>years, Congressional Republicans have taken the lead

<br>and Job Creation Act; and the Coast Guard and Mar-

<br>process,  eliminate  unnecessary  programs,  and  give
<br>States  more  flexibility  to  address  their  particular
<br>needs.  It  is  a  return  to  the  principles  of  federalism,
<br>and it contains not a single earmark.  It should be fol-
<br>lowed by reform of the 42-year old National Environ-

<br>infrastructure projects, expedite their timetables, and
<br>limit litigation against them.
<br>Securing  sufficient  funding  for  the  Highway

<br>infrastructure  will  be  among  them.  In  some  States
<br>with  elected  officials  dominated  by  the Democratic

<br>The Free Trade Agreements negotiated with friendly

<br>pact  with  Israel  in  1985  facilitated  the  creation  of
<br>nearly  ten  million  jobs  supported  by  our  exports.
<br>That  record  makes  all  the  more  deplorable  the
<br>current  Administration’s  slowness  in  completing

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">to  pursue  any  new  trade  agreements  with  friendly
<br>nations.
<br>This  worldwide  explosion  of  trade  has  had  a
<br>downside, however, as some governments have used
<br>a variety of unfair means to limit American access to
<br>their  markets  while  stealing  our  designs,  patents,
<br>brands, know-how, and technology—the “intellectual
<br>property”  that drives  innovation. The chief offender
<br>is China, which  has  built  up  its  economy  in  part  by
<br>piggybacking  onto Western  technological  advances,
<br>manipulates  its  currency  to  the  disadvantage  of
<br>American  exporters,  excludes  American  products
<br>from  government  purchases,  subsidizes  Chinese
<br>companies to give them a commercial advantage, and
<br>invents  regulations  and  standards  designed  to  keep
<br>out  foreign  competition.  The  current  Administra-
<br>tion’s way of dealing with all these violations of world
<br>trade standards has been a virtual surrender. 
<br>Republicans understand that you can succeed in
<br>a  negotiation  only  if  you  are  willing  to  walk  away
<br>from  it.   Thus, a Republican President will  insist on
<br>full parity in trade with China and stand ready to im-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">pose countervailing duties if China fails to amend its
<br>currency policies.  Commercial discrimination will be
<br>met  in  kind. Counterfeit  goods will  be  aggressively
<br>kept out of the country. Victimized private firms will
<br>be encouraged to raise claims in both U.S. courts and
<br>at the World Trade Organization.  Punitive measures
<br>will be imposed on foreign firms that misappropriate
<br>American technology and intellectual property. Until
<br>China  abides  by  the  WTO’s  Government  Procure-
<br>ment Agreement, the United States government will
<br>end procurement of Chinese goods and services.

<br>the  hard-working  American.  The  high  rates  of
<br>unemployment  over  the  last  three  and  a half  years—
<br>disastrously high among youth, minorities, and veter-
<br>ans—have thus been a tragic waste of energy and ideas,
<br>compounded  by  the  waste  of  billions  in  “stimulus”
<br>funds with no payoff in jobs.  The chief cause has been
<br>an unprecedented uncertainty in the American free en-
<br>terprise system due to the overreaching policies of the
<br>current Administration. Nothing
<br>matters  more  than  getting  the
<br>American people back to work. In
<br>addition  to  cutting  spending,
<br>keeping  taxes  low,  and  curtailing
<br>bureaucratic red tape, we must re-
<br>place  outdated policies  and  inef-
<br>fectual  training programs with  a

<br>tury workforce  to make  the most
<br>of our country’s human capital.
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">It  is  critical  that  the United
<br>States  has  a  highly  trained  and
<br>skilled  workforce.    Nine  federal  agencies  currently
<br>run 47 retraining programs at a total cost of $18 bil-
<br>lion  annually with  dismal  results. Both  the  trainees
<br>in those programs and the taxpayers who fund them
<br>deserve  better.  We  propose  consolidation  of  those
<br>programs into State block grants so that training can
<br>be  coordinated  with  local  schools  and  employers.
<br>That  will  be  critically  important  if  States  establish

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">compact  which  confirms  our  God-given  individual
<br>rights and assures that all Americans stand equal be-
<br>fore the law. Perhaps the greatest political document
<br>ever written, it defines the purposes and limits of gov-
<br>ernment and is the blueprint for ordered liberty that
<br>makes  the  U.S.  the  world’s  freest, most  stable,  and
<br>most prosperous nation. Its Constitutional ideals have
<br>been emulated around the world, and with them has
<br>come unprecedented prosperity for billions of people. 
<br>In the spirit of the Constitution, we consider dis-
<br>crimination  based  on  sex,  race,  age,  religion,  creed,
<br>disability,  or  national  origin
<br>unacceptable  and  immoral.   We
<br>will 
<br>strongly  enforce  anti-
<br>discrimination  statutes  and  ask
<br>all  to  join  us  in  rejecting  the
<br>forces  of  hatred  and  bigotry
<br>and in denouncing all who prac-
<br>tice  or  promote  racism,  anti-
<br>Semitism,  ethnic  prejudice,  or
<br>religious  intolerance.  We  sup-
<br>port  efforts  to  help  low-income
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">individuals  get  a  fair  chance
<br>based on their potential and individual merit; but we
<br>reject preferences, quotas, and set-asides as the best
<br>or  sole  methods  through  which  fairness  can  be
<br>achieved, whether in government, education, or cor-
<br>porate  boardrooms.    In  a  free  society,  the  primary
<br>role  of  government  is  to  protect  the God-given,  in-
<br>alienable, inherent rights of its citizens, including the
<br>rights  to  life,  liberty,  and  the  pursuit  of  happiness.
<br>Merit, ability, aptitude, and results should be the fac-
<br>tors that determine advancement in our society.
<br>The  Republican  Party 
<br>includes  Americans
<br>from every faith and tradition, and our policies and po-
<br>sitions  respect  the  right  of  every  American  to
<br>follow  his  or  her  beliefs  and  underscore  our
<br>reverence for the religious freedom envisioned by the
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">Founding  Fathers  of  our  nation  and  of  our  party.

<br>Congress and the Executive
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">We salute Republican Members of the House of
<br>Representatives  for  enshrining  in  the  Rules  of  the
<br>House  the  requirement  that  every  bill must  cite  the
<br>provision of the Constitution which permits its intro-
<br>duction. Their adherence  to  the Constitution stands
<br>in stark contrast to the antipathy toward the Consti-
<br>tution  demonstrated  by  the  current Administration
<br>and  its  Senate  allies  by  appoint-
<br>ing    “czars”  to  evade  the  confir-
<br>mation process, making unlawful
<br>“recess”  appointments when  the
<br>Senate is not in recess, using ex-
<br>ecutive orders to bypass the sep-
<br>aration of powers  and  its  checks
<br>and balances, encouraging illegal
<br>actions  by  regulatory  agencies
<br>from  the  NLRB  to  the  EPA,
<br>openly  and  notoriously  display-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">ing  contempt  for  Congress,  the
<br>Judiciary, and the Constitutional prerogatives of the
<br>individual States, refusing to defend the nation’s laws
<br>in  federal  courts  or  enforce  them  on  the  streets,  ig-
<br>noring  the  legal  requirement  for  legislative  enact-
<br>ment of an annual budget, gutting welfare reform by
<br>unilaterally removing its statutory work requirement,
<br>buying senatorial votes with special favors, and evad-
<br>ing the legal requirement for congressional consulta-
<br>tion  regarding  troop  commitments  overseas.    A
<br>Republican President and Republican Senate will join
<br>House Republicans  in  living  by  the  rule  of  law,  the
<br>foundation of the American Republic.
<br>Protecting America is the first and most impor-
<br>tant  duty  of  our  federal  government. The Constitu-
<br>tion wisely distributes important roles in the area of
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">national security to both the President and Congress.

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">closely together—in war and in peace—to advance our

<br>An Activist Judiciary
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">A  serious  threat  to  our  country’s  constitutional
<br>order, perhaps even more dangerous than presiden-
<br>tial  malfeasance,  is  an  activist  judiciary,  in  which
<br>some  judges  usurp  the  powers  reserved  to  other
<br>branches of government.  A blatant example has been
<br>the court-ordered redefinition of marriage in several
<br>States.  This  is more  than  a matter  of warring  legal
<br>concepts  and  ideals.  It  is  an  assault  on  the  founda-
<br>tions of our society, challenging the institution which,
<br>for thousands of years  in virtually every civilization,
<br>has been  entrusted with  the  rearing of  children  and
<br>the transmission of cultural values. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:53px; top:12208px; width:207px; height:221px;"><span style="font-family: ACYVNP+Georgia-Bold; font-size:9px">A Sacred Contract: Defense of Marriage
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">That is why Congressional Republicans took the
<br>lead in enacting the Defense of Marriage Act, affirm-
<br>ing the right of States and the federal government not
<br>to recognize same-sex relationships licensed in other
<br>jurisdictions.  The current Administration’s open de-
<br>fiance of this constitutional principle—in its handling
<br>of  immigration  cases,  in  federal  personnel  benefits,
<br>in  allowing  a  same-sex marriage  at  a military  base,
<br>and  in  refusing  to  defend  DOMA  in  the  courts—
<br>makes  a mockery  of  the President’s  inaugural  oath.
<br>We commend the United States House of Represen-
<br>tatives  and  State  Attorneys  General  who  have  de-
<br>fended  these  laws when  they  have  been  attacked  in
<br>the  courts. We  reaffirm  our  support  for  a Constitu-
<br>tional amendment defining marriage as the union of
<br>one man and one woman. We applaud the citizens of
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">the majority of States which have enshrined in their

<br>we support the campaigns underway in several other
<br>States to do so.

<br>A Constitutional Budget
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">Republican Members  of Congress  have  repeat-
<br>edly  tried  to  reform  the  budget  process  to  make  it
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">more  transparent  and  accountable,  in  particular  by
<br>voting for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Con-
<br>stitution,  following  the  lead of 33 States which have
<br>put  that  restraint  into  their  own  constitutions. We
<br>call  for  a  Constitutional  amendment  requiring  a
<br>super-majority  for  any  tax  increase with  exceptions
<br>for only war and national emergencies, and imposing
<br>a cap limiting spending to the historical average per-
<br>centage of GDP so that future Congresses cannot bal-
<br>ance the budget by raising taxes.

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">We  support  the  review  and  examination  of  all
<br>federal  agencies  to  eliminate wasteful  spending,  op-
<br>erational  inefficiencies,  or  abuse  of  power  to deter-
<br>mine whether they are performing functions that are
<br>better  performed  by  the  States.  These  functions,  as
<br>appropriate,  should be  returned  to  the States  in  ac-
<br>cordance with  the Tenth Amendment  of  the United
<br>States  Constitution.  We  affirm  that  all  legislation,
<br>rules, and  regulations must  conform and public  ser-
<br>vants must adhere  to  the U.S. Constitution, as origi-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">nally  intended  by  the  Framers.    Whether  such
<br>legislation is a State or federal matter must be deter-
<br>mined in accordance with the Tenth Amendment, in
<br>conjunction with Article I, Section 8.
<br>When  the Constitution  is  evaded,  transgressed,
<br>or ignored, so are the freedoms it guarantees.  In that
<br>context, the elections of 2012 will be much more than
<br>a contest between parties. They are a referendum on
<br>the future of liberty in America. 
<br>The Republican Party, born in opposition to the
<br>denial of  liberty,  stands  for  the  rights of  individuals,
<br>families,  faith  communities,  institutions  –  and  of
<br>the  States  which  are  their  instruments  of  self-
<br>government.  In establishing a federal system of gov-
<br>ernment, the Framers viewed the States as laborato-
<br>ries of democracy and centers of innovation, as do we.

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">In fidelity to that principle, we condemn the cur-
<br>rent Administration’s continued assaults on State gov-
<br>ernments  in  matters  ranging  from  voter  ID  laws  to
<br>immigration,  from  healthcare  programs  to  land  use
<br>decisions. Our States are the laboratories of democracy
<br>from which the people propel our nation forward, solv-
<br>ing  local  and State problems  through  local  and State
<br>innovations.  We pledge to restore the proper balance
<br>between the federal government and the governments
<br>closest to, and most reflective of, the American people.
<br>Scores of entrenched federal programs violate the con-
<br>stitutional mandates  of  federalism  by  taking money
<br>from the States, laundering it through various federal
<br>agencies, only to return to the States shrunken grants
<br>with mandates attached.  We propose wherever feasi-
<br>ble  to  leave  resources  where  they  originate:  in  the
<br>homes  and neighborhoods of  the  taxpayers.   We  call
<br>on the federal government to do a systematic analysis
<br>of  laws  and  regulations  to  eliminate  costly  bureau-
<br>cratic  mandates on the States and the people. 
<br>With  every  right  comes  a  responsibility.   A  few
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">States  and  their  political  subdivisions  are  currently
<br>in  dire  fiscal  situations,  largely  because  of  their
<br>spending, debt, and failure to rein in public employee
<br>unions. In the event those conditions worsen, the fed-
<br>eral government must not assume the State govern-
<br>ments’  or  their  political  subdivisions’  financial
<br>responsibility or require the nation’s taxpayers to pay
<br>for the misrule of a few State governments.   Nor shall
<br>the States assume the federal government’s financial
<br>responsibility.

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">Honest  elections  are  the  foundation  of  represen-

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">ballot access for the elderly, the handicapped, military
<br>personnel, and all authorized voters.  For the same rea-
<br>son, we applaud legislation to require photo identifica-
<br>tion  for  voting  and  to  prevent  election  fraud,
<br>particularly with  regard  to  registration  and  absentee
<br>ballots.  We support State laws that require proof of cit-
<br>izenship at the time of voter registration to protect our
<br>electoral system against a significant and growing form
<br>of voter fraud.  Every time that a fraudulent vote is cast,
<br>it effectively cancels out a vote of a legitimate voter. 
<br>Voter  fraud  is  political  poison.  It  strikes  at  the
<br>heart of representative government. We call on every
<br>citizen, elected official, and member of the  judiciary
<br>to preserve  the  integrity of  the vote. We call  for vig-
<br>orous prosecution of voter fraud at the State and fed-
<br>eral  level.  To  do  less  disenfranchises  present  and
<br>future generations.  We recognize that having a phys-
<br>ical verification of the vote  is the best way to ensure
<br>a  fair  election.  “Let  ambition  counter  ambition,”  as
<br>James Madison  said.   When  all  parties  have  repre-
<br>sentatives  observing  the  counting  of  ballots  in  a
<br>transparent process, integrity is assured.  We strongly
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">support  the policy  that  all  electronic  voting  systems
<br>have a voter verified paper audit trail.  
<br>States or political subdivisions that use all-mail
<br>elections  cannot  ensure  the  integrity  of  the  ballot.
<br>When  ballots  are  mailed  to  every  registered  voter,
<br>ballots can be stolen or  fraudulently voted by unau-
<br>thorized  individuals  because  the  system  does  not
<br>have a way to verify the identity of the voter.  We call
<br>for  States  and  political  subdivisions  to  adopt  voting
<br>systems that can verify the identity of the voter.
<br>Military men and women must not be disenfran-
<br>chised from the very freedom they defend. We affirm
<br>that  our  troops,  wherever  stationed,  be  allowed  to
<br>vote  and  those  votes  be  counted  in  the  November
<br>election  and  in  all  elections. To  that  end,  the  entire

<br>The Foresight of Our Founders to 
<br>Protect Religious Freedom
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">The first provision of the First Amendment con-
<br>cerns  freedom  of  religion.  That  guarantee  reflected
<br>Thomas  Jefferson’s  Virginia  Statute  for  Religious
<br>Freedom, which declared  that no  one  should  “suffer
<br>on account of his religious opinion or belief, but that
<br>all men  shall be  free  to profess,  and by  argument  to
<br>maintain, their opinion in matters of religion….”  That
<br>assurance  has  never  been  more  needed  than  it  is
<br>today,  as  liberal  elites  try  to drive  religious beliefs—
<br>and religious believers—out of the public square. The
<br>Founders of the American Republic universally agree
<br>that democracy presupposes a moral people and that,
<br>in  the  words  of  George Washington’s  Farewell  Ad-
<br>dress,  “Of  all  the dispositions  and habits which  lead
<br>to political prosperity, religion and morality are indis-
<br>pensable supports.”
<br>The most offensive  instance of  this war on  reli-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">gion  has  been  the  current Administration’s  attempt
<br>to compel faith-related institutions, as well as believ-
<br>ing individuals, to contravene their deeply held reli-
<br>gious,  moral,  or  ethical  beliefs  regarding  health
<br>services,  traditional  marriage,  or  abortion.  This
<br>forcible secularization of religious and religiously af-
<br>filiated organizations, including faith-based hospitals
<br>and  colleges,  has  been  in  tandem  with  the  current
<br>Administration’s  audacity  in  declaring which  faith-
<br>related activities are, or are not, protected by the First
<br>Amendment—an  unprecedented  aggression  repudi-
<br>ated by a unanimous Supreme Court in its </span><span style="font-family: YFFBXI+Georgia-Italic; font-size:8px">Hosanna-

<br>An “All of the Above” Energy Policy
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">The Republican Party is committed to domestic
<br>energy  independence.  The  United  States  and  its
<br>neighbors to the North and South have been blessed
<br>with  abundant  energy  resources,  tapped  and  un-
<br>tapped,  traditional  and  alternative,  that  are  among
<br>the  largest  and most  valuable  on  earth.  Advancing
<br>technology has given us a more accurate understand-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">ing  of  the  nation’s  enormous  reserves  that  are  ours
<br>for the development.  The role of public officials must
<br>be to encourage responsible development across the
<br>board.    Unlike  the  current  Administration,  we  will
<br>not  pick  winners  and  losers  in  the  energy  market-
<br>place.    Instead, we will  let  the  free market  and  the
<br>public’s  preferences  determine  the  industry  out-
<br>comes.  In assessing the various sources of potential
<br>energy, Republicans advocate an all-of-the-above di-
<br>versified approach, taking advantage of all our Amer-
<br>ican  God-given  resources.  That  is  the  best  way  to
<br>advance North American energy independence.
<br>Our policies aim at energy security to ensure an
<br>affordable,  stable,  and  reliable  energy  supply  for  all
<br>parts  of  the  country  and  all  sectors  of  the  economy.
<br>Energy security is intimately linked to national secu-
<br>rity  both  in  terms  of  our  current  dependence  upon
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">foreign  supplies  and  because  some  of  the  hundreds

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">the hands of terrorist groups that wish to harm us.  A
<br>growing,  prosperous  economy  and  our  standard  of
<br>living and quality of life, moreover, depend on afford-
<br>able and abundant domestic energy supplies.  
<br>A strong and stable energy sector is a job gener-
<br>ator  and  a  catalyst  of  economic  growth,  not  only  in
<br>the labor-intensive energy industry but also in its sec-
<br>ondary markets.   The Republican Party will encour-
<br>age  and  ensure  diversified  domestic  sources  of
<br>energy, from research and development, exploration,
<br>production,  transportation,  transmission,  and  con-
<br>sumption  in  a  way  that  is  economically  viable  and
<br>job-producing,  as  well  as  environmentally  sound.
<br>When  our  energy  industry  is  revitalized,  millions
<br>more  Americans  will  find  work  in  manufacturing,
<br>food production, metals, minerals, packaging, trans-
<br>portation and other fields – because of the jobs that
<br>will be created in, and as a result of, the energy sector.
<br>We  are  determined  to  create  jobs,  spur  economic
<br>growth,  lower  energy  prices,  and  strengthen  our
<br>energy industry.

<br>better  services,  but  also  to  rethink  and  restructure
<br>government  to bring  it  into  the  twenty-first  century.
<br>Government  reform  requires  constant  vigilance  and
<br>effort because government by  its nature  tends  to ex-
<br>pand in both size and scope. Our goal is not just less
<br>spending in Washington but something far more im-
<br>portant  for  the  future  of  our  nation:  protecting  the
<br>constitutional rights of citizens, sustainable prosper-
<br>ity, and strengthening the American family. 
<br>It  isn’t enough  to merely downsize government,
<br>having  a  smaller  version  of  the  same  failed  systems.
<br>We must do things in a dramatically different way by
<br>reversing  the  undermining  of
<br>federalism  and  the  centralizing
<br>of  power  in  Washington.    We
<br>look  to  the  example  set  by  Re-
<br>publican Governors and  legisla-
<br>tors  all  across  the nation. Their
<br>leadership  in  reforming  and
<br>reengineering  government  clos-
<br>est  to  the  people  vindicates  the
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">role of the States as the laborato-
<br>ries of democracy.  
<br>Our approach, like theirs, is
<br>two-fold.    We  look  to  govern-
<br>ment—local, State, and federal—
<br>for the things government must
<br>do,  but we  believe  those  duties
<br>can  be  carried  out more  efficiently  and  at  less  cost.
<br>For all other activities, we look to the private sector;
<br>for  the American  people’s  resourcefulness,  produc-
<br>tivity,  innovation,  fiscal  responsibility,  and  citizen-
<br>leadership  have  always  been  the  true  foundation  of
<br>our national greatness. 
<br>For much  of  the  last  century,  an  opposing  view
<br>has dominated public policy where we have witnessed
<br>the expansion, centralization, and bureaucracy in an
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">entitlement  society.  Government  has  lumbered  on,

<br>future generations—face massive indebtedness, while
<br>Congressional Democrats  and  the  current Adminis-
<br>tration  block  every  attempt  to  turn  things  around.
<br>This man-made  log-jam—the  so-called  stalemate  in
<br>Washington—particularly  affects  the  government’s
<br>three largest programs, which have become central to
<br>the  lives  of untold millions  of Americans: Medicare,
<br>Medicaid, and Social Security.

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">The  Republican  Party  is  committed  to  saving
<br>Medicare and Medicaid. Unless  the programs’  fiscal
<br>ship  is  righted,  the  individuals
<br>hurt the first and the worst will be
<br>those  who  depend  on  them  the
<br>most.   We will  save Medicare  by
<br>modernizing  it,  by  empowering
<br>its participants, and by putting it
<br>on a secure financial footing. This
<br>will be an enormous undertaking,
<br>and  it  should  be  a  non-partisan
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">one.  We  welcome  to  the  effort
<br>all who  sincerely want  to  ensure
<br>the  future  for  our  seniors  and
<br>the  poor. Republicans  are  deter-

<br>candid  and  honest  presentation
<br>of  the  problem  and  its  solutions
<br>to the American people.
<br>Despite  the  enormous  differences  between
<br>Medicare and Medicaid, the two programs share the
<br>same  fiscal outlook:  their current courses cannot be
<br>sustained.   Medicare  has  grown  from more  than  20
<br>million enrolled in 1970 to more than 47 million en-
<br>rolled  today, with  a  projected  total  of  80 million  in

<br>has  close  to  $37  trillion  in  unfunded  obligations,
<br>while total Medicaid spending will more than double
<br>by  2019.  In many  States, Medicaid’s mandates  and
<br>inflexible  bureaucracy  have  become  a  budgetary
<br>black  hole,  growing  faster  than  most  other  budget
<br>lines and devouring funding for many other essential
<br>governmental functions. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">The problem goes beyond finances. Poor quality
<br>healthcare is the most expensive type of care because
<br>it prolongs affliction and  leads  to  ever more  compli-
<br>cations.  Even  expensive  prevention  is  preferable  to
<br>more costly treatment later on.  When approximately
<br>80 percent of healthcare costs are related to  lifestyle
<br>–smoking, obesity, substance abuse–far greater em-
<br>phasis has to be put upon personal responsibility for
<br>health maintenance.  Our goal for both Medicare and
<br>Medicaid must be to assure that every participant re-
<br>ceives  the amount of care  they need at  the  time  they
<br>need it, whether for an expectant mother and her baby
<br>or for someone in the last moments of life.  Absent re-
<br>forms, these two programs are headed for bankruptcy
<br>that will endanger care for seniors and the poor.  
<br>The first step is to move the two programs away
<br>from  their  current  unsustainable  defined-benefit
<br>entitlement  model  to  a  fiscally  sound  defined-
<br>contribution model. This is the only way to limit costs
<br>and  restore consumer choice  for patients and  intro-
<br>duce  competition;  for  in  healthcare,  as  in  any  other
<br>sector  of  the  economy,  genuine  competition  is  the
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">best guarantee of better care at lower cost.  It is also
<br>the best guard against the fraud and abuse that have
<br>plagued Medicare  in  its  isolation  from  free market
<br>forces, which  in  turn  costs  the  taxpayers  billions  of
<br>dollars  every  year. We  can  do  this  without making
<br>any changes  for  those 55 and older. While  retaining
<br>the  option  of  traditional  Medicare  in  competition
<br>with  private  plans, we  call  for  a  transition  to  a  pre-
<br>mium-support model for Medicare, with an income-
<br>adjusted  contribution  toward  a  health  plan  of  the
<br>enrollee’s  choice.  This  model  will  include  private
<br>health insurance plans that provide catastrophic pro-
<br>tection, to ensure the continuation of doctor-patient
<br>relationships.  Without  disadvantaging  retirees  or
<br>those  nearing  retirement,  the  age  eligibility  for
<br>Medicare  must  be  made  more  realistic  in  terms  of
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">today’s longer life span.

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">Medicaid,  as  the  dominant  payer  in  the  health
<br>market  in  regards  to  long-term  care,  births,  and  in-
<br>dividuals with mental  illness,  is  the  next  frontier  of
<br>welfare reform.  It is simply too big and too flawed to
<br>be managed  in  its  current  condition  from Washing-
<br>ton.    Republican  Governors  have  taken  the  lead  in
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">proposing  a  host  of  regulatory  changes  that  could
<br>make the program more flexible, innovative, and ac-
<br>countable. There  should  be  alternatives  to  hospital-
<br>ization for chronic health problems. Patients could be
<br>rewarded  for participating  in disease prevention ac-
<br>tivities. Excessive mandates  on  coverage  should  be
<br>eliminated. Patients with long-term care needs might
<br>fare better in a separately designed program.  
<br>As those and other specific proposals show, Re-
<br>publican Governors and State  legislatures are  ready
<br>to do the hard work of modernizing Medicaid for the
<br>twenty-first  century. We  propose  to  let  them  do  all
<br>that and more by block-granting the program to the
<br>States, providing the States with the flexibility to de-
<br>sign  programs  that meet  the  needs  of  their  low  in-
<br>come  citizens.  Such  reforms  could  be  achieved
<br>through premium supports or a refundable tax credit,
<br>allowing  non-disabled  adults  and  children  to  be
<br>moved  into private health  insurance of  their choice,
<br>where  their  needs  can  be met  on  the  same  basis  as
<br>those of more affluent Americans.  For the aged and
<br>disabled  under Medicaid,  for  whom monthly  costs
<br>can  be  extremely  high,  States would  have  flexibility
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">to improve the quality of care and to avoid the inap-
<br>propriate institutional placing of patients who prefer
<br>to be cared for at home.

<br>on a sound fiscal basis that will give workers control

<br>Unlike Social Security, the problems facing pri-
<br>vate  pension  plans  are  both  demographic  and
<br>ethical.   While pension law may be complicated, the
<br>current  bottom  line  is  that many  plans  are  increas-
<br>ingly underfunded by overestimating their rates of re-
<br>turn  on  investments.  This  in  turn  endangers  the
<br>integrity  of  the  Pension  Guaranty  Benefit  Corpora-
<br>tion, which  is  itself  seriously underfunded.    In both
<br>cases,  the  taxpayers  will  be  expected  to  pay  for  a
<br>bailout. As the first step toward possible corrective ac-
<br>tion, we call for a presidential panel to review the pri-
<br>vate  pension  system  in  this  country  of  only  those
<br>private  pensions  that  are  backed  by  the  Pension
<br>Guaranty  Benefit  Corporation  and  to  make  public
<br>its findings.
<br>The situation of public pension systems demands
<br>immediate remedial action. The irresponsible prom-
<br>ises  of politicians  at  every  level  of  government have
<br>come back to haunt today’s taxpayers with enormous
<br>unfunded pension  liabilities. Many  cities  face bank-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">ruptcy  because  of  excessive  outlays  for  early  retire-
<br>ment, extravagant health plans, and overly generous
<br>pension benefits. We salute the Republican Governors
<br>and  State  legislators  who  have,  in  the  face  of
<br>abuse  and  threats  of  violence,  reformed  their  State
<br>pension systems for the benefit of both taxpayers and
<br>retirees alike.

<br>ful  guide,  not  a  punitive  threat.   Worst  of  all,  over-
<br>regulation is a stealth tax on everyone as the costs of
<br>compliance  with  the  whims  of  federal  agencies  are
<br>passed along to the consumers at the cost of $1.75 tril-

<br>which  ensure  the  safety  of  food  and medicine,  espe-

<br>the Dodd-Frank Act on financial services, or the EPA’s

<br>and second, and rein in the third.  We support a sun-
<br>set  requirement  to  force  reconsideration  of  out-of-

<br>to  require  congressional  approval  for  all new major

<br>The bottom line on regulations is jobs. In listen-

<br>crippling  effect  of  even well-intentioned  regulation.
<br>That makes it all the more important for federal agen-
<br>cies to be judicious about the impositions they create
<br>on businesses, especially small businesses. We call for
<br>a moratorium on the development of any new major
<br>and costly regulations until a Republican Administra-

<br>omy. By giving responsible access to credit, it helped
<br>small businesses grow, created jobs, and made Amer-
<br>icans the best-housed people in history.   By funding
<br>innovation, financial services underwrote our future.
<br>Then came the financial collapse of 2008 and a crit-
<br>ical  reassessment  of  the  role  and
<br>condition  of  financial  institu-
<br>tions—most  of which,  it must  be

<br>intervention,  which  has  already  frozen  investment
<br>and  job  creation and  threatens  to make  financial  in-

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">Despite improvements as a result of Republican
<br>nominations to the judiciary, some judges in the fed-
<br>eral courts remain far afield from their constitutional
<br>limitations.  The U.S.  Constitution  is  the  law  of  the
<br>land.  Judicial  activism  which  includes  reliance  on
<br>foreign law or unratified treaties undermines Amer-
<br>ican law. The sole solution, apart from impeachment,
<br>is  the  appointment  of  constitutionalist  jurists, who
<br>will  interpret  the  law  as  it  was  originally  intended
<br>rather  than make  it. That  is  both  a  presidential  re-
<br>sponsibility,  in  selecting  judicial  candidates,  and  a
<br>senatorial  responsibility,  in  confirming  them.    We
<br>urge Republican Senators to do all  in their power to
<br>prevent the elevation of additional leftist ideologues
<br>to  the  courts,  particularly  in  the waning  days  of  the
<br>current Administration.
<br>In addition to appointing activist judges, the cur-
<br>rent  Administration  has  included  an  activist  and
<br>highly  partisan Department  of  Justice.   With  a Re-
<br>publican Administration,  the Department will  stop
<br>suing States  for exercising  those powers  reserved  to
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">the States, will stop abusing its preclearance author-
<br>ity  to  block  photo-ID  voting  laws,  and will  fulfill  its

<br>cluding the Defense of Marriage Act.

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">The  greatest  asset  of  the American  economy  is
<br>the  American  worker.    Just  as  immigrant  labor
<br>helped build our country in the past, today’s legal im-
<br>migrants are making vital contributions in every as-
<br>pect  of  our  national  life.    Their  industry  and
<br>commitment  to  American  values  strengthens  our
<br>economy, enriches our culture, and enables us to bet-
<br>ter understand and more effectively compete with the
<br>rest  of  the  world.    Illegal  immigration  undermines
<br>those benefits and affects U.S. workers. In an age of
<br>terrorism, drug cartels, human trafficking, and crim-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">inal  gangs,  the  presence  of millions  of  unidentified
<br>persons in this country poses grave risks to the safety
<br>and the sovereignty of the United States.  Our highest
<br>priority, therefore, is to secure the rule of law both at
<br>our borders and at ports of entry.  
<br>We  recognize  that  for  most  of  those  seeking
<br>entry into this country, the lack of respect for the rule
<br>of  law  in  their  homelands  has meant  economic  ex-
<br>ploitation and political oppression by corrupt elites.
<br>In this country, the rule of law guarantees equal treat-
<br>ment  to  every  individual,  including more  than  one
<br>million  immigrants  to  whom  we  grant  permanent
<br>residence  every  year.  That  is  why  we  oppose  any
<br>form of amnesty for those who, by intentionally vio-
<br>lating  the  law, disadvantage  those who have obeyed
<br>it.   Granting  amnesty  only  rewards  and  encourages

<br>in  2006,  but  never  completed,

<br>ans of the services they need, and long-term failures
<br>threaten to undermine tribal sovereignty itself. 
<br>American Indians have established elected tribal
<br>governments  to  carry  out  the  public  policies  of  the
<br>tribe,  administer  services  to  its  tribal member  con-
<br>stituents,  and manage  relations with  federal,  State,
<br>and local governments. We respect the tribal govern-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">ments as the voice of their communities and encour-
<br>age  federal,  State,  and  local  governments  to  heed
<br>those  voices  in  developing  programs  and  partner-
<br>ships  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  for  American
<br>Indians and their neighbors in their  communities. 
<br>Republicans  believe 
<br>that  economic  self-
<br>sufficiency  is  the  ultimate  answer  to  the  challenges
<br>confronting  Indian  country.  We  believe  that  tribal
<br>governments  and  their  communities,  not Washing-
<br>ton bureaucracies, are best situated to craft solutions
<br>that will  end  systemic  problems  that  create  poverty
<br>and disenfranchisement.  Just as the federal govern-
<br>ment  should  not  burden  States with  regulations,  it
<br>should not stifle the development of resources within
<br>the reservations, which need federal assistance to ad-
<br>vance  their commerce nationally  through roads and
<br>technology. Federal and State regulations that thwart
<br>job  creation must  be withdrawn  or  redrawn  so  that
<br>tribal governments acting on behalf of American In-
<br>dians are not disadvantaged. It is especially egregious
<br>that  the  Democratic  Party  has  persistently  under-
<br>mined  tribal  sovereignty  in  order  to  provide  advan-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">tage to union bosses in the tribal workplace. 
<br>Republicans  recognize  that  each  tribe  has  the
<br>right of consultation before any new regulatory policy
<br>is implemented on tribal land. To the extent possible,
<br>such consultation  should take place in Indian coun-
<br>try with the tribal government and its members. Be-
<br>fore  promulgating  and  imposing  any  new  laws  or
<br>regulations affecting trust land or members, the fed-
<br>eral  government  should  encourage  Indian  tribes  to
<br>develop their own policies to achieve program objec-
<br>tives, and should defer to tribes to develop their own
<br>standards,  or  standards  in  conjunction  with  State
<br>governments.  
<br>Republicans reject a one-size-fits-all approach to
<br>federal-tribal-State partnerships and will work to ex-

<br>ture generations, modernize and improve the Indian
<br>Health  Service  to make  it more  responsive  to  local

<br>country in cooperation with tribal neighbors. Our ap-
<br>proach  is  to  empower  American  Indians,  through
<br>tribal  self-determination  and  self-governance  poli-

<br>without undue federal interference. 
<br>Like all Americans, American Indians want safe
<br>communities  for  their  families;  but  inadequate  re-
<br>sources and neglect have, over time, allowed criminal
<br>activities to plague Indian country. To protect every-
<br>one—and  especially  the most  vulnerable:  children,
<br>women,  and  elders—the  legal  system  in  tribal  com-
<br>munities must provide stability and protect property
<br>rights. Everyone’s  due  process  and  civil  rights must
<br>be safeguarded.  
<br>We  support  efforts  to  ensure  equitable  partici-
<br>pation in federal programs by American Indians, in-
<br>cluding Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians and to
<br>preserve their culture and languages that we consider
<br>to  be  national  treasures.  Lastly,  we  recognize  that
<br>American Indians have responded to the call for mil-
<br>itary service in percentage numbers far greater than
<br>have other groups of Americans. We honor that com-
<br>mitment,  loyalty, and sacrifice of all American Indi-
<br>ans  serving  in  the military  today  and  in  years  past
<br>and will ensure that all veterans and their families re-

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">The  institution of marriage  is  the  foundation of
<br>civil society.   Its success as an  institution will deter-
<br>mine our success as a nation.  It has been proven by
<br>both  experience  and  endless  social  science  studies
<br>that  traditional marriage  is  best  for  children.   Chil-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">dren  raised  in  intact  married  families  are  more
<br>likely  to  attend  college,  are physically  and  emotion-

<br>The  success  of  marriage  directly  impacts  the  eco-
<br>nomic well-being  of  individuals.    Furthermore,  the
<br>future of marriage affects freedom.  The lack of family
<br>formation not only  leads to more government costs,

<br>of its citizens in all aspects.  We recognize and honor

<br>1996 marked a revolution in government’s approach
<br>to poverty. They changed the standard for policy suc-
<br>cess  from  the  amount  of  income  transferred  to  the
<br>poor to the number of poor who moved from welfare
<br>to  economic  independence.  We  took  the  belief  of
<br>most Americans—that welfare  should be a hand up,
<br>not a hand out—and made it law. Work requirements,
<br>though modest, were at the heart of this success. That
<br>is why so many are now outraged by the current Ad-
<br>ministration’s  recent  decision  to  permit waivers  for
<br>work  requirements  for  welfare  benefits,  in  other
<br>words, to administratively repeal the most successful
<br>anti-poverty policy in memory. Instead of undermin-
<br>ing the expectation that low-income parents and in-
<br>dividuals should strive to support themselves, benefit
<br>programs  like  food  stamps must  ensure  that  those
<br>benefits  are  better  targeted  to  those who  need  help
<br>the most.  
<br>For the sake of low-income families as well as the
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">taxpayers, the federal government’s entire system of
<br>public assistance  should be  reformed  to ensure  that
<br>it  promotes work. Each  year,  this  system  dispenses
<br>nearly $1  trillion  in  taxpayer  funds across a maze of
<br>approximately 80 programs that are neither coordi-
<br>nated  nor  effective  in  solving  poverty  and  lifting  up
<br>families.  For  many  individuals  collecting  benefits
<br>from multiple  categorical  programs,  efforts  to work
<br>or  earn more  actually  result  in  less money  in  their
<br>pocket  through  the  resulting  loss  of  benefits.    This
<br>poverty trap would ensnare even more Americans  if
<br>Obamacare  were  implemented.  Taking  a  part  time
<br>job,  working  an  extra  shift,  or  even  just  marrying
<br>someone who works, would  result  in a  loss of bene-
<br>fits,  thereby  discouraging  the  very  acts  necessary  to
<br>achieve the American Dream.

<br>Improve Quality and Lower Costs
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">We believe that taking care of one’s health is an
<br>individual  responsibility. Chronic diseases, many  of
<br>them  related  to  lifestyle,  drive  healthcare  costs,  ac-
<br>counting  for  more  than  75  percent  of  the  nation’s
<br>medical  spending. To  reduce  demand,  and  thereby
<br>lower  costs, we must  foster  personal  responsibility
<br>while increasing preventive serv-
<br>ices to promote healthy lifestyles.
<br>We  believe  that  all  Americans
<br>should  have  improved  access  to
<br>affordable,  coordinated,  quality
<br>healthcare, including individuals
<br>struggling with mental illness. 
<br>Our goal is to encourage the
<br>development of a healthcare sys-
<br>tem  that  provides  higher  quality
<br>care at a  lower cost  to all Ameri-

<br>tions,  contain  costs  and  reduce mandates,  simplify
<br>the  system  for  patients  and  providers,  restore  cuts
<br>made to Medicare, and equalize the tax treatment of
<br>group  and  individual  health  insurance  plans.    For
<br>most Americans, those who are insured now or who
<br>seek insurance in the future, our practical, non-intru-
<br>sive  reforms will promote  flexibility  in State  leader-
<br>ship  in  healthcare  reform,  promote  a  free-market
<br>based system, and empower consumer choice. All of
<br>which will return direction of the nation’s healthcare

<br>through  reinsurance  and  risk  adjustment;  and  pro-

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">the  increased  costs  of  medical  mandates,  imposed
<br>under their laws, which may price many low-income

<br>and subsidies  for abortion and healthcare plans  that
<br>include abortion coverage.
<br>To achieve a free market in healthcare and ensure
<br>competition, we will promote price  transparency  so
<br>that  consumers  will  know  the  actual  cost  of  treat-

<br>aware of costs, they are less likely to over-utilize serv-

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">Parents are responsible for the education of their
<br>children. We  do  not  believe  in  a  one  size  fits  all  ap-
<br>proach to education and support providing broad ed-
<br>ucation  choices  to  parents  and  children  at  the  State
<br>and  local  level.   Maintaining American preeminence
<br>requires a world-class system of education, with high
<br>standards, in which all students can reach their poten-
<br>tial. Today’s education reform movement calls for ac-
<br>countability  at  every  stage  of  schooling.  It  affirms
<br>higher  expectations  for  all  students  and  rejects  the
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">crippling bigotry of low expectations. It recognizes the
<br>wisdom of State and local control of our schools, and
<br>it wisely sees consumer rights in education—choice—
<br>as the most  important driving force for renewing our
<br>schools. 
<br>Education  is much more than schooling. It  is the
<br>whole  range of  activities by which  families  and  com-
<br>munities  transmit  to  a  younger  generation,  not  just
<br>knowledge and skills, but ethical and behavioral norms
<br>and traditions. It is the handing over of a personal and
<br>cultural identity. That is why education choice has ex-
<br>panded  so vigorously.  It  is also why American educa-
<br>tion has, for the last several decades, been the focus of
<br>constant controversy, as centralizing forces outside the
<br>family and community have sought  to remake educa-
<br>tion  in order  to  remake America. They have not  suc-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">ceeded, but they have done immense damage.

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">Since 1965 the federal government has spent $2
<br>trillion on elementary and secondary education with
<br>no  substantial  improvement  in  academic  achieve-
<br>ment  or  high  school  graduation  rates  (which  cur-
<br>rently are 59 percent for African-American students
<br>and 63 percent for Hispanics). The U.S. spends an av-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">erage  of  more  than  $10,000  per  pupil  per  year  in
<br>public schools, for a total of more than $550 billion.
<br>That represents more than 4 percent of GDP devoted
<br>to K-12  education  in  2010. Of  that  amount,  federal
<br>spending  was  more  than  $47  billion.  Clearly,  if
<br>money  were  the  solution,  our  schools  would  be
<br>problem-free.
<br>More  money  alone  does  not  necessarily  equal
<br>better performance. After years of trial and error, we
<br>know what does work, what has actually made a dif-
<br>ference in student advancement, and what is power-
<br>ing  education  reform  at  the  local  level  all  across
<br>America:  accountability  on  the  part  of  administra-
<br>tors,  parents  and  teachers;  higher  academic  stan-
<br>dards;  programs  that  support  the  development  of
<br>character and financial literacy; periodic rigorous as-
<br>sessments on the fundamentals, especially math, sci-
<br>ence, reading, history, and geography; renewed focus
<br>on the Constitution and the writings of the Founding
<br>Fathers, and an accurate account of American history
<br>that  celebrates  the  birth  of  this  great  nation;  trans-
<br>parency, so parents and the public can discover which
<br>schools  best  serve  their  pupils;  flexibility  and  free-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">dom to innovate, so schools can adapt to the special
<br>needs of their students and hold teachers and admin-
<br>istrators  responsible  for  student  performance.  We
<br>support  the  innovations  in  education  reform  occur-
<br>ring at the State level based upon proven results. Re-
<br>publican Governors  have  led  in  the  effort  to  reform
<br>our  country’s  underperforming  education  system,
<br>and we applaud these advancements. 
<br>We advocate the policies and methods that have
<br>proven  effective:  building  on  the  basics,  especially
<br>STEM  subjects  (science,  technology,  engineering,
<br>and math)  and  phonics;  ending  social  promotions;
<br>merit  pay  for  good  teachers;  classroom  discipline;
<br>parental involvement; and strong leadership by prin-
<br>cipals,  superintendents,  and  locally  elected  school
<br>boards. Because technology has become an essential

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">The Republican Party is the party of fresh and in-
<br>novative  ideas  in education.   We support options for
<br>learning, including home schooling and local innova-
<br>tions like single-sex classes, full-day school hours, and
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">year-round schools. School choice—whether through
<br>charter schools, open enrollment requests, college lab
<br>schools,  virtual  schools,  career  and  technical  educa-
<br>tion programs, vouchers, or tax credits—is important
<br>for  all  children,  especially  for  families with  children
<br>trapped  in  failing  schools.   Getting  those  youngsters
<br>into decent learning environments and helping them
<br>to realize their full potential is the greatest civil rights
<br>challenge of our  time.   We support  the promotion of
<br>local career and  technical educational programs and
<br>entrepreneurial programs  that have been  supported
<br>by leaders in industry and will retrain and retool the
<br>American workforce, which  is  the best  in  the world.
<br>A young person’s ability to achieve in school must be
<br>based on his or her God-given talent and motivation,
<br>not an address, zip code, or economic status.
<br>In  sum, on  the one hand enormous amounts of
<br>money are being spent for K-12 public education with
<br>overall  results  that  do  not  justify  that  spending. On
<br>the other hand,  the  common  experience of  families,
<br>teachers, and administrators forms the basis of what
<br>does work in education. We believe the gap between
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">those  two  realities  can  be  successfully  bridged,  and
<br>Congressional Republicans  are  pointing  a  new way
<br>forward with major  reform  legislation.   We  support
<br>its concept of block grants and the repeal of numer-
<br>ous federal regulations which interfere with State and
<br>local control of public schools.  
<br>The bulk of the federal money through Title I for
<br>low-income children and through IDEA for disabled
<br>youngsters  should  follow  the  students  to  whatever
<br>school  they  choose  so  that  eligible  pupils,  through
<br>open enrollment, can bring their share of the funding
<br>with  them.   The Republican-founded D.C. Opportu-
<br>nity  Scholarship Program  should  be  expanded  as  a
<br>model for the rest of the country.  We deplore the ef-
<br>forts  by  Congressional  Democrats  and  the  current
<br>President  to  kill  this  successful  program  for  disad-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">vantaged  students  in  order  to  placate  the  leaders  of

<br>of  students  before  the  special  interests  of  unions
<br>when approaching elementary and secondary educa-
<br>tion reform. 
<br>Because  parents  are  a  child’s  first  teachers, we
<br>support family literacy programs, which improve the
<br>reading, language, and life skills of both parents and
<br>children from low-income families. To ensure that all
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">students have access to the mainstream of American
<br>life, we  support  the English  First  approach  and  op-
<br>pose divisive programs that limit students’ ability to
<br>advance in American society.   We renew our call for
<br>replacing “family planning” programs for teens with
<br>abstinence education which teaches abstinence until
<br>marriage as  the  responsible and  respected  standard
<br>of  behavior.   Abstinence  from  sexual  activity  is  the
<br>only  protection  that  is  100  percent  effective  against
<br>out-of-wedlock pregnancies and sexually-transmitted
<br>diseases including HIV/AIDS when transmitted sex-
<br>ually.    It  is  effective,  science-based,  and  empowers
<br>teens  to achieve optimal health outcomes and avoid
<br>risks of sexual activity.  We oppose school-based clin-
<br>ics  that  provide  referrals,  counseling,  and  related
<br>services for abortion and contraception.  We support
<br>keeping federal funds from being used in mandatory
<br>or  universal  mental  health,  psychiatric,  or  socio-
<br>emotional screening programs.  
<br>We  applaud  America’s  great  teachers,  who
<br>should  be  protected  against  frivolous  litigation  and
<br>should be able to take reasonable actions to maintain
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">discipline  and  order  in  the  classroom.   We  support
<br>legislation that will correct the current law provision
<br>which defines a “Highly Qualified Teacher” merely by
<br>his  or  her  credentials,  not  results  in  the  classroom.
<br>We urge school districts to make use of teaching tal-
<br>ent in business, STEM fields, and in the military, es-
<br>pecially among our returning veterans. Rigid tenure
<br>systems based on the “last in, first out” policy should
<br>be replaced with a merit-based approach that can at-
<br>tract fresh talent and dedication to the classroom. All
<br>personnel who  interact with  school  children  should
<br>pass  background  checks  and  be  held  to  the  highest

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">College costs, however, are on an unsustainable
<br>trajectory, rising year by year far ahead of overall in-
<br>flation. Nationwide,  student  loan  debt  now  exceeds
<br>credit  card  debt,  roughly  $23,300  for  each  of  the
<br>35,000,000 debtors, taking years to pay off. Over 50
<br>percent  of  recent  college  grads  are  unemployed  or
<br>underemployed, working  at  jobs  for which  their  ex-
<br>pensive educations gave them no training. It  is time
<br>to  get  back  to  basics  and  to  higher  education  pro-
<br>grams directly related to job opportunities. 
<br>The  first  step  is  to  acknowledge  the  need  for
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">change when the status quo is not working. New sys-
<br>tems  of  learning  are  needed  to  compete with  tradi-
<br>tional  four-year  colleges:  expanded  community
<br>colleges  and  technical  institutions,  private  training
<br>schools,  online  universities,  life-long  learning,  and
<br>work-based learning in the private sector. New mod-
<br>els for acquiring advanced skills will be ever more im-
<br>portant  in  the  rapidly  changing  economy  of  the
<br>twenty-first  century,  especially  in  science,  technol-
<br>ogy, engineering, and math. Public policy should ad-
<br>vance the affordability, innovation, and transparency
<br>needed  to  address  all  these  challenges  and  to make
<br>accessible  to  everyone  the  emerging  alternatives,
<br>with  their  lower  cost  degrees,  to  traditional  college
<br>attendance.
<br>Federal student aid is on an unsustainable path,

<br>to  make  prudent  choices  about  a  student’s  future:
<br>completion  rates,  repayment  rates,  future  earnings,
<br>and other factors that may affect their decisions.   The
<br>federal government should not be in the business of
<br>originating student loans; however, it should serve as
<br>an insurance guarantor for the private sector as they
<br>offer  loans  to  students.   Private  sector  participation
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">in student financing should be welcomed. Any regu-
<br>lation that drives tuition costs higher must be reeval-
<br>uated to balance its worth against its negative impact
<br>on students and their parents.

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">The most effective forces in reducing crime and

<br>munities  supported  by  excellent  law  enforcement.
<br>Both reinforce constructive conduct and ethical stan-
<br>dards by setting examples and providing safe havens
<br>from dangerous and destructive behaviors.  But even
<br>under  the  best  social  circumstances,  strong,  well-
<br>trained law enforcement is necessary to protect us all,
<br>and especially the weak and vulnerable, from preda-
<br>tors.   Our  national  experience  over  the  last  several
<br>decades  has  shown  that  citizen  vigilance,  tough  but
<br>fair prosecutors, meaningful sentences, protection of
<br>victims’  rights,  and  limits  on  judicial  discretion  can
<br>preserve  public  safety  by  keeping  criminals  off  the
<br>streets.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">Liberals  do  not  understand  this  simple  axiom:
<br>criminals behind bars cannot harm the general pub-

<br>against  children,  repeat  drug  dealers,  rape,  robbery
<br>and murder. We support a national registry for con-
<br>victed  child murderers.   We  oppose  parole  for  dan-
<br>gerous  or  repeat  felons.  Courts  should  have  the
<br>option  of  imposing  the  death  penalty  in  capital
<br>murder cases.
<br>In  solidarity with  those who  protect  us, we  call
<br>for mandatory  prison  time  for  all  assaults  involving
<br>serious injury to law enforcement officers. Criminals
<br>injured  in  the  course  of  their  crimes  should  not  be
<br>able  to  seek monetary damages  from  their  intended

<br>can  give  law  enforcement  the  flexibility  it  needs  in

<br>Public  authorities must  regain  control  of  their

<br>to  become  ethnic  or  racial  battlegrounds.  Persons
<br>jailed for whatever cause should be protected against
<br>cruel  or  degrading  treatment  by  other  inmates.  In
<br>some cases, the institution of family-friendly policies
<br>may curtail prison violence and reduce the rate of re-
<br>cidivism,  thus  reducing  the enormous  fiscal and  so-
<br>cial costs of incarceration. Breaking the cycle of crime
<br>begins with the children of those who are prisoners.
<br>Deprived  of  a  parent  through  no  fault  of  their  own,

<br>on Victims of Crime, calling the neglect of crime vic-
<br>tims a “national disgrace,” proposed a Constitutional
<br>amendment  to  secure  their  formal  rights.    While
<br>some  progress  has  been made  to  rectify  that  situa-
<br>tion, the need for national action still persists in the
<br>unacceptable treatment of innocent victims. We call
<br>on the States to make  it a bipartisan priority to pro-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">tect  the  rights  of  crime  victims, who  should  also  be
<br>assured of access to social and legal services; and we
<br>call  on  the  Congress  to  make  the  federal  courts  a
<br>model in this regard for the rest of the country.  
<br>The  resources  of  the  federal  government’s
<br>law  enforcement  and  judicial  systems  have  been
<br>strained  by  two  unfortunate  expansions:  the  over-
<br>criminalization  of behavior  and  the  over-federaliza-
<br>tion of offenses. The number of criminal offenses  in
<br>the  U.S.  Code  increased  from  3,000  in  the  early
<br>1980s  to  over  4,450  by  2008.  Federal  criminal  law
<br>should  focus  on  acts  by  federal  employees  or  acts
<br>committed  on  federal  property –  and  leave  the  rest
<br>to the States.   Then Congress should withdraw from
<br>federal departments and agencies the power to crim-
<br>inalize  behavior,  a  practice which,  according  to  the
<br>Congressional Research Service, has created “tens of
<br>thousands” of criminal offenses.   No one other  than
<br>an  elected  representative  should  have  the  authority
<br>to define a criminal act and set criminal penalties. In
<br>the same way, Congress should reconsider the extent
<br>to  which  it  has  federalized  offenses  traditionally

<br>more than one conflict at a time.  It relies on the good
<br>intentions and capabilities of international organiza-
<br>tions to justify constraining American military readi-
<br>ness. Finally, the strategy subordinates our national
<br>security  interests  to    environmental,  energy,  and
<br>international  health  issues,  and  elevates  “climate
<br>change” to the level of a “severe threat” equivalent to
<br>foreign  aggression. The word  “climate,”  in  fact,  ap-
<br>pears  in  the  current President’s  strategy more often
<br>than Al Qaeda,  nuclear  proliferation,  radical  Islam,
<br>or weapons of mass destruction.  The phrase “global

<br></span><span style="font-family: ACYVNP+Georgia-Bold; font-size:9px">The Cybersecurity Danger
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">The  frequency,  sophistication,  and  intensity  of
<br>cyber-related incidents within the United States have
<br>increased steadily over the past decade and will con-
<br>tinue to do so until it is made clear that a cyber attack
<br>against  the United States will not be  tolerated.   The
<br>current Administration’s cyber security policies have
<br>failed  to  curb malicious  actions  by  our  adversaries,
<br>and no wonder, for there is no active deterrence pro-
<br>tocol. The current deterrence framework is overly re-
<br>liant on the development of defensive capabilities and
<br>has been unsuccessful in dissuading cyber-related ag-
<br>gression.  The  U.S.  cannot  afford  to  risk  the  cyber-
<br>equivalent of Pearl Harbor.  
<br>The  government  and  private  sector  must
<br>work  together  to  address  the  cyberthreats  posed  to
<br>the United  States,  help  the  free  flow  of  information
<br>between network managers,  and  encourage  innova-
<br>tion  and  investment  in  cybersecurity.   The  govern-
<br>ment  must  do  a  better  job  of  protecting  its  own
<br>systems, which  contain  some  of  the most  sensitive
<br>data and  control  some of our most  important  facili-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">ties.  As such, we encourage an immediate update of
<br>the law that was drafted a decade ago to improve the
<br>security of  government  information  systems.   Addi-
<br>tionally, we must invest in continuing research to de-
<br>velop  cutting-edge  cybersecurity  technologies  to
<br>protect  the U.S.   However, we acknowledge  that  the
<br>most effective way of combating potential cybersecu-
<br>rity  threats  is  sharing  cyberthreat  information  be-
<br>tween  the  government  and  industry,  as  well  as
<br>protecting  the  free  flow  of  information  within  the
<br>private sector.  
<br>The  current Administration’s  laws  and  policies
<br>undermine what  should  be  a  collaborative  relation-
<br>ship  and put both  the  government  and private  enti-
<br>ties  at  a  severe  disadvantage 
<br>in  proactively

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">We  will  honor  President  Reagan’s  legacy  of
<br>peace  through strength by advancing  the most cost-
<br>effective programs and policies crucial to our national
<br>security,  including  our  economic  security  and  fiscal
<br>solvency.    To  do  that,  we must  honestly  assess  the
<br>threats  facing  this  country,  and we must  be  able  to
<br>articulate candidly to the American people our prior-
<br>ities  for  the use of  taxpayer dollars  to address  those
<br>threats.
<br>We must deter any adversary who would attack
<br>us or use terror as a tool of government. Every poten-
<br>tial enemy must have no doubt that our capabilities,
<br>our  commitment,  and  our  will  to  defeat  them  are
<br>clear, unwavering, and unequivocal.  We must imme-
<br>diately  employ  a  new  blueprint  for  a National Mili-
<br>tary  Strategy  that  is  based  on  an  informed  and
<br>validated assessment of the potential threats we face,
<br>one  that  restores  as  a  principal  objective  the  deter-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">rence using the full spectrum of our military capabil-
<br>ities.  As  Ronald  Reagan  proved  by  the  victorious
<br>conclusion  of  the  Cold  War,  only  our  capability  to
<br>wield  overwhelming military  power  can  truly  deter
<br>the  enemies  of  the  United  States  from  threatening
<br>our people and our national interests.    
<br>In order to deter aggression from nation-states,
<br>we must maintain military and technical superiority
<br>through  innovation while  upgrading  legacy  systems
<br>including  aircraft  and  armored  vehicles.  We  must
<br>deter  the  threat  posed  by  rogue  aggressors with  the
<br>assurance that justice will be served through state-of-
<br>the-art surveillance, enhanced special operations ca-
<br>pabilities, and unmanned aerial systems. 
<br>We  will  employ  the  full  range  of  military  and
<br>intelligence  options  to  defeat  Al  Qaeda  and  its

<br>sive  and  just  detainee  policy  that  treats  those  who
<br>would  attack  our  nation  as  enemy  combatants. We
<br>will accept no arms control agreement that limits our
<br>right to self-defense; and we will fully deploy a missile
<br>defense shield for the people of the United States and
<br>for our allies.
<br>We will  pursue  an  effective  cybersecurity  strat-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">egy,  supported by  the necessary  resources,  that  rec-
<br>ognizes  the  importance  of  offensive  capabilities.
<br>Whether it is a nation-state actively probing our na-

<br>ing  to  obtain  destructive  cyber  capabilities,  or  a
<br>criminal  network’s  theft  of  intellectual  property,
<br>more must be done  to deter, defeat,  and  respond  to
<br>cyberthreats.  
<br>We will  restore  the morale and advance  the  ca-
<br>pabilities  of  our  intelligence  community  to  ensure
<br>that  the President  and  our military  leaders  are  fully
<br>informed in an uncertain and increasingly dangerous
<br>world. We will  restore  accountability  to  ensure  that
<br>our nation’s most sensitive information and activities
<br>are protected appropriately.  
<br>The Department of Defense, like all government
<br>agencies, needs to be careful to spend taxpayers’ dol-
<br>lars wisely. We will  implement  sound management
<br>policies  to  ensure  the  timely,  cost-effective  delivery
<br>of  the  tools our  troops need  to  fight. We reject Con-
<br>gressional earmarks that put personal and parochial
<br>interests ahead of military effectiveness and the best
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">interests  of  the  nation. We  recognize  the  need  for,

<br>Consistent  with  this  commitment,  we  believe

<br>women as we honor our promises and commitments

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">continue and not be reduced or otherwise diminished
<br>while  in  service,  or  upon  separation,  or  retirement.
<br>The  combat  readiness  of  our  Armed  Forces  is  the
<br>foundation of strength and deterrence.  Readiness re-
<br>quires  a  consistent  and  sustained  investment  in  the
<br>training and re-equipping of our military personnel.
<br>We will never assume the risk of reduced readiness,
<br>and we can never return to the “hollow” forces of the
<br>1970s.   Combat  readiness  also  requires  that we  re-
<br>serve  troops  for  truly  necessary  operations  by  not
<br>overextending them around the world.
<br>We  recognize  that  drastic  cuts  to  our military’s
<br>end strength pose severe national security challenges.
<br>To avoid the overextension of our forces, we support
<br>a larger active force and oppose cuts to the National
<br>Guard and Reserves.
<br>The  all-volunteer  force,  begun  on  the watch  of
<br>Republican Presidents, has carried America to victory

<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">vancement  of women  in  the military, which has not
<br>only opened doors of opportunity for individuals but
<br>has also made possible  the devoted, and often heroic,
<br>services of additional members of every branch of the
<br>Armed Forces. We support military women’s exemp-
<br>tion  from  direct  ground  combat  units  and  infantry
<br>battalions.  We affirm the cultural values that encour-
<br>age selfless service and superiority  in battle, and we
<br>oppose anything which might divide or weaken team
<br>cohesion,  including  intra-military  special  interest
<br>demonstrations.   We will  support  an  objective  and
<br>open-minded review of the current Administration’s
<br>management  of military  personnel  policies  and will
<br>correct  problems  with  appropriate  administrative,

<br>from employers as  they  return  to  the  civilian world.
<br>Especially  in  light  of  the  high  unemployment  rates
<br>faced  by  younger Reserve  and Guard members, we

<br>The  spiritual welfare  of  our  troops  and  retired

<br>of one a day, with post-service medical conditions, in-
<br>cluding  addiction  and mental  illness,  and  with  the
<br>financial stress and homelessness that is often related
<br>to these factors, there is an urgent need for the kind
<br>of  counseling  that  faith-based  institutions  can  best
<br>provide.  We  support  rights  of  conscience  and
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">religious  freedom  for military  chaplains  and  people
<br>of  faith.  A  Republican  Commander  in  Chief  will
<br>protect religious independence of military chaplains

<br>gious symbols from military facilities. We will enforce
<br>and  defend  in  court  the  Defense  of  Marriage  Act
<br>(DOMA) in the Armed Forces as well as in the civilian
<br>world.
<br>We  call  upon  the  entire  chain  of  command—
<br>from  the President  and  the  Secretary  of Defense,  to
<br>base  and  unit  commanders—to  ensure  that  our
<br>troops  and  retired  service members, wherever  sta-
<br>tioned, have the opportunity to vote in the November

<br>Our wounded warriors, whether still in service or
<br>discharged, deserve the best medical care our country
<br>can  provide.  The  nature  of  the  fighting  in  Iraq  and
<br>Afghanistan has  resulted  in  an unprecedented  inci-
<br>dence  of  traumatic  brain  injury,  loss  of  limbs,  and
<br>post-traumatic  stress disorder which  calls  for  a new
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">commitment of resources and personnel for its treat-
<br>ment  and  care  to promote  recovery. We must make
<br>military and veterans’ medicine the gold standard for
<br>mental  health  care,  advances  in
<br>prosthetics,  and  treatment  of
<br>trauma and eye injuries. We must
<br>heed  Abraham  Lincoln’s  com-
<br>mand  “to  care  for him who bore
<br>the battle.”   To  care,  as well,  for
<br>the  families  of  those  who  have
<br>made  the ultimate sacrifice, who
<br>must  be  assured  of  meaningful
<br>financial assistance, remains our
<br>solemn duty.
<br>Because  the  conditions  of
<br>warfare  have  changed  dramati-
<br>cally  since  the  war  on  terror
<br>began,  today’s  veterans  face  new  challenges. Asym-
<br>metrical or non-traditional warfare results  in a high
<br>incidence of severe conditions that must receive high
<br>priority and call for continued research into preven-
<br>tion and treatment. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">We  are  committed  to  ending  homelessness  for
<br>our  veterans. One  key  is  to  assist  their  reentry  into
<br>the job market as soon as possible after military serv-
<br>ice ends. A job for a veteran is more than a source of
<br>income.  It  is  a  new mission, with  a  new  status,  and
<br>the transition can be difficult.  It is a national scandal
<br>that veterans are one of  the groups with  the highest
<br>unemployment  rates. We  urge  the  private  sector  to
<br>make hiring vets a company policy and commend the
<br>many  organizations  that  have  specific  programs  to
<br>accomplish  this.  But  the  federal  government  must
<br>take the lead by simplifying the paper work required
<br>for a tax break for hiring a veteran and by giving vets
<br>their  assured  place  at  the  head  of  the  training  and
<br>employment line.
<br>Every State has an office dealing with veterans.

<br>International Organizations
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">Since the end of World War II, the United States,
<br>through  the  founding  of  the  United  Nations  and
<br>NATO,  has  participated  in  a wide  range  of  interna-
<br>tional  organizations  which  can,  but  sometimes  do
<br>not,  serve  the  cause of peace  and prosperity.   While
<br>acting  through  them,  our  country  must  always  re-
<br>serve  the  right  to  go  its  own  way.  There  can  be  no
<br>substitute for principled American leadership. 
<br>The United Nations  remains  in dire need of  re-
<br>form, starting with full transparency in the financial
<br>operations of its overpaid bureaucrats. As long as its
<br>scandal-ridden  management  continues,  as  long  as
<br>some  of  the world’s worst  tyrants  hold  seats  on  its
<br>Human  Rights  Council,  and  as  long  as  Israel  is
<br>treated as a pariah state, the U.N. cannot expect the
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">full support of the American people.
<br>The  United  Nations  Population  Fund  has  a
<br>shameful  record  of  collaboration with China’s  pro-
<br>gram of compulsory abortion.  We affirm the Repub-
<br>lican Party’s long-held position known as the Mexico
<br>City Policy,  first  announced  by President Reagan  in
<br>1984, which prohibits the granting of federal monies
<br>to  non-governmental  organization  that  provide  or
<br>promote abortion.
<br>Under our Constitution, treaties become the law
<br>of  the  land.  So  it  is  all  the more  important  that  the
<br>Congress—the Senate through its ratifying power and
<br>the House through its appropriating power—shall  re-
<br>ject  agreements  whose  long-range  impact  on  the
<br>American  family  is  ominous  or  unclear.    These  in-
<br>clude  the U.N. Convention  on Women’s Rights,  the
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">Convention  on  the Rights  of  the Child,  the Conven-

<br>the  U.N.  Arms  Trade  Treaty  as  well  as  the  various
<br>declarations  from  the U.N. Conference  on Environ-
<br>ment  and Development. Because  of  our  concern  for
<br>American sovereignty, domestic management of our
<br>fisheries, and our country’s long-term energy needs,
<br>we have deep reservations about the regulatory, legal,
<br>and tax regimes inherent in the Law of the Sea Treaty
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">and congratulate Senate Republicans for blocking its
<br>ratification. We strongly reject the U.N. Agenda 21 as
<br>erosive of American sovereignty, and we oppose any
<br>form of U.N. Global Tax. We oppose any diplomatic
<br>efforts that could result in giving the United Nations
<br>unprecedented  control  over  the  Internet.    Interna-
<br>tional  regulatory  control  over  the  open  and  free  In-
<br>ternet would  have  disastrous  consequences  for  the
<br>United States and the world.
<br>To  shield  members  of  our  Armed  Forces  and
<br>others  in service  to America  from  ideological prose-
<br>cutions  overseas,  the Republican Party  does not  ac-
<br>cept  the  jurisdiction  of  the  International  Criminal

<br>is  based  on  an  outdated,  statist,  government-to-

<br>ment. The economic success and political progress of

<br>peoples  and  others  for  greater  freedom,  and  we
<br>hope  that  greater  liberty—and  with  it,  a  greater
<br>chance  for  peace—will  result  from  the  recent
<br>turmoil. Many governments in the region have given
<br>substantial  assistance  to  the  U.S.  over  the  last
<br>decade  because  they  understood  that  our  struggle
<br>against terror is not an ethnic or religious fight, and
<br>that violent extremists are abusers of their faith, not
<br>its champions.  
<br>On the other hand, radical elements like Hamas
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">and Hezbollah must be  isolated because  they do not
<br>meet the standards of peace and diplomacy of the in-
<br>ternational community. We call for the restoration of
<br>Lebanon’s  independence,  which  those  groups  have
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:278px; top:41226px; width:207px; height:407px;"><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">virtually  destroyed.   We  support  the  transition  to  a
<br>post-Assad Syrian government that is representative
<br>of its people, protects the rights of all minorities and
<br>religions, respects the territorial integrity of its neigh-
<br>bors, and contributes to peace and stability in the re-
<br>gion.  We  offer  a  continuing  partnership  with  the
<br>people of Iraq, who have endured extremist terror to
<br>now  have  a  chance  to  build  their  own  security  and
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">democracy. We urge  special  efforts  to preserve  and
<br>protect  the  ethnic  and  religious  diversity  of  their
<br>nation.
<br>Iran’s  pursuit  of  nuclear  weapons  capability
<br>threatens America, Israel, and the world. That threat
<br>has only become worse during the current Adminis-
<br>tration.  A  continuation  of  its  failed  engagement
<br>policy  with  Iran  will  lead  to  nuclear  cascade.  In
<br>solidarity with the international community, America
<br>must  lead  the  effort  to  prevent  Iran  from  building
<br>and  possessing  nuclear  weapons  capability.  We
<br>express our  respect  for  the people of  Iran, who seek
<br>peace  and  aspire  to  freedom.  Their  current  regime
<br>is unworthy of  them.  It  exports  terror  and provided
<br>weapons  that  killed  our  troops  in  Iraq.  We  affirm
<br>the  unanimous  resolution  of  the U.S.  Senate  calling
<br>for  “elections  that  are  free,  fair,  and meet  interna-
<br>tional standards” and “a representative and respon-
<br>sive  democratic  government  that  respects  human
<br>rights,  civil  liberties,  and  the  rule  of  law.”   We  urge
<br>the  next  Republican  President  to  unequivocally
<br>assert  his  support  for  the  Iranian  people  as  they
<br></span><span style="font-family: IEOHWK+Georgia; font-size:7px">protest  their  despotic  regime.  We  must  retain  all
<br>options  in  dealing  with  a  situation  that  gravely
<br>threatens  our  security,  our  interests,  and  the  safety
<br>of our friends.
