<br>2012 Democratic National Platform 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:9px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:9px">Moving America Forward 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>Four years ago, Democrats, independents, and many Republicans came together as Americans to move our country 
<br>forward. We were in the midst of the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, the previous administration 
<br>had put two wars on our nation’s credit card, and the American Dream had slipped out of reach for too many.  
<br> 
<br>Today, our economy is growing again, al-Qaeda is weaker than at any point since 9/11, and our manufacturing sector 
<br>is growing for the first time in more than a decade. But there is more we need to do, and so we come together again 
<br>to continue what we started. We gather to reclaim the basic bargain that built the largest middle class and the most  
<br>prosperous nation on Earth – the simple principle that in America, hard work should pay off, responsibility should be 
<br>rewarded, and each one of us should be able to go as far as our talent and drive take us.  
<br> 
<br>This election is not simply a choice between two candidates or two political parties, but between two fundamentally 
<br>different paths for our country and our families. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">We Democrats offer America the opportunity to move our country forward by creating an economy built to last and 
<br>built from the middle out. Mitt Romney and the Republican Party have a drastically different vision. They still believe 
<br>the best way to grow the economy is from the top down – the same approach that benefited the wealthy few but 
<br>crashed the economy and crushed the middle class. 
<br> 
<br>Democrats see a young country continually made stronger by the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity in the 
<br>world, and a nation of people drawn to our shores from every corner of the globe. We believe America can succeed 
<br>because the American people have never failed and there is nothing that together we cannot accomplish. 
<br> 
<br>Reclaiming the economic security of the middle class is the challenge we must overcome today. That begins by 
<br>restoring the basic values that made our country great, and restoring for everyone who works hard and plays by the 
<br>rules the opportunity to find a job that pays the bills, turn an idea into a profitable business, care for your family, affor d 
<br>a home you call your own and health care you can count on, retire with dignity and respect, and, most of all, give your 
<br>children the kind of education that allows them to dream even bigger and go even further than you ever imagined.  
<br> 
<br>This has to be our North Star – an economy that’s built not from the top down, but from a growing middle class, and 
<br>that provides ladders of opportunity for those working hard to join the middle class. 
<br> 
<br>This is not another trivial political argument. It’s the defining issue of our time and at the core of the American Dream. 
<br>And now we stand at a make-or-break moment, and are faced with a choice between moving forward and falling 
<br>back. 
<br> 
<br>The Republican Party has turned its back on the middle class Americans who built this country. Our opponents 
<br>believe we should go back to the top-down economic policies of the last decade. They think that if we simply 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">eliminate protections for families and consumers, let Wall Street write its own rules again, and cut taxes for the 
<br>wealthiest, the market will solve all our problems on its own. They argue that if we help corporations  and wealthy 
<br>investors maximize their profits by whatever means necessary, whether through layoffs or outsourcing, it will 
<br>automatically translate into jobs and prosperity that benefits us all. They would repeal health reform, turn Medicare 
<br>into a voucher program, and follow the same path of fiscal irresponsibility of the past administration – giving trillions of 
<br>dollars in tax cuts weighted towards millionaires and billionaires while sticking the middle class with the bill. But we’ve 
<br>tried their policies – and we’ve all suffered when they failed. 
<br> 
<br>It is not enough to go back to where the country was before the crisis. We must rebuild a strong foundation that 
<br>ensures it never happens again. 
<br> 
<br>Democrats know that America prospers when we’re all in it together. We see an America where everyone has a fair 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">shot, does their fair share, and plays by the same rules. We see an America that out -educates, out-builds, and out-
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">innovates the rest of the world. 
<br> 
<br>We see an America with greater economic security and opportunity, driven by education, energy, innovation and 
<br>infrastructure, and a tax code that helps to create American jobs and bring down the debt in a balanced way. We 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:794px; width:2px; height:11px;"><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Calibri; font-size:7px">

<div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:965px; width:470px; height:635px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">believe in deficit reduction not by placing the burden on the middle class and the poor, but by cu tting out programs we 
<br>can’t afford and asking the wealthiest to again contribute their fair share. 
<br> 
<br>These values are why we enacted historic health care reform that provides economic security for families and 
<br>enacted sweeping financial reform legislation that will prevent the recklessness that cost so many their jobs, homes, 
<br>and savings. They’re why we rescued the auto industry and revived our manufacturing supply chain. They’re why we 
<br>helped American families who are working multiple jobs and struggling to pay the bills save a little extra money 
<br>through tax cuts, lower health care costs, and affordable student  loans. 
<br> 
<br>They’re why we fought to reclaim the value of treating all Americans with dignity and respect. And they’re why 
<br>President Barack Obama has ended one war and is responsibly drawing down another. They’re why we’re restoring 
<br>our alliances and image around the world and pursuing a foreign policy that’s making us safer. 
<br> 
<br>But there is more to be done. We knew that renewing the American Dream wouldn’t be easy – we knew it would take 
<br>more than one year, or one term, or even one president. 
<br> 
<br>The problems we’re facing right now have been more than a decade in the making. We are the party of  inclusion and 
<br>respect differences of perspective and belief. And so, even when we disagree, we work together to move this country 
<br>forward. But what is holding our nation back is a stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views 
<br>of which direction America should take. 
<br> 
<br>We must keep moving forward and doing the hard work of rebuilding a strong economy by betting on the American 
<br>worker and investing in a growing middle class.  We need a government that stands up for the hopes, values, and 
<br>interests of working people, and gives everyone willing to work hard the chance to make the most of their God -given 
<br>potential. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:9px">Rebuilding Middle Class Security 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>We’ve come a long way since 2008. The President took office in the middle of the worst economic downturn since the 
<br>Great Depression; that month 800,000 Americans los t their jobs – more than in any single month in the previous 60 
<br>years. On Day One, he took immediate action to stop the free fall and put Americans back to work. In the midst of the 
<br>crisis, President Obama knew what Democrats have always known: that American workers are tougher than tough 
<br>times. Since early 2010, the private sector has created 4.5 million jobs, and American manufacturing is growing for 
<br>the first time since the 1990s. 
<br> 
<br>The President knew from the start that to rebuild true middle class security, we can’t just cut our way to prosperity. 
<br>We must out-educate, out-innovate, and out-build the world. We need an economy that creates the jobs of the future 
<br>and makes things the rest of the world buys – not one built on outsourcing, loopholes, or risky financial deals that 
<br>jeopardize everyone, especially the middle class. 
<br> 
<br>We’ve already made historic progress. States have more flexibility to raise standards and reform schools, more 
<br>students are receiving grants and scholarships, and young adults can stay on their parents’ health  insurance plans as 
<br>they finish their education and enter the workforce. More working families than ever before have received tax cuts, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">and fuel-efficiency standards are doubling. The President cracked down on Wall Street recklessness and abuses by 
<br>health insurance, credit card, and mortgage companies. 
<br> 
<br>Our work is far from done. A crisis this deep didn’t happen overnight and it won’t be solved overnight.  
<br>Too many parents sit around their kitchen tables at night after they’ve put their kids to bed, worrying about how they 
<br>will make a mortgage payment or pay the rent, or how they will put their children through college. We now stand at a 
<br>make-or-break moment for families, and America faces a clear choice in this election: move forward toward a nation 
<br>built from the middle class out where everyone has the chance to get ahead, or go back to the same failed ideas that 
<br>created the crisis in the first place. 
<br> 
<br>The Republicans in Congress and Mitt Romney have a very different idea about where they want to take this country. 
<br>To pay for their trillions in additional tax cuts weighted towards  millionaires and billionaires, they’ll raise taxes on the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">middle class and gut our investments in education, research and technology, and new roads, bridges, and airports. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">They’ll end Medicare as we know it. They want to let Wall Street write its own rules again and allow insurance 
<br>companies to once again deny health care to working families. Their troubling and familiar economic scheme doubles 
<br>down on the same bad ideas of the last decade while arguing that, somehow, this time, they’ll lead to a different 
<br>result. We can’t afford to go back or abandon the change we’ve fought so hard for. We have to move forward.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,BoldItalic; font-size:7px">Putting Americans Back to Work 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>When President Obama took office, the economy was in the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression. His 
<br>Recovery Act represented the largest education investment since President Johnson, the largest infrastructure 
<br>investment since President Eisenhower, the single largest clean energy investment ever, and the broadest tax cut in 
<br>American history. It helped keep teachers, police officers, nurses, and firefighters on the job. It ensured that as we re-
<br>built our country, we bought American-made iron, steel, and manufactured goods wherever feasible, consistent with 
<br>our international obligations. It helped the President stop the bleeding and reverse the free fall. 
<br> 
<br>But just as the recession was not created overnight, we knew it would take time to recover from the crisis – and more 
<br>needs to be done. Last September, President Obama put forward the American Jobs Act to provide an immediate 
<br>boost to the economy and strengthen the recovery. We have already enacted key parts of the American Jobs Act – 
<br>payroll tax relief, tax credits for businesses that hire veterans, and an extension of unemployment insurance that also 
<br>included reforms like work-sharing, a “Bridge to Work” to help the long-term unemployed reconnect with the labor 
<br>force, and support for unemployed workers looking to become entrepreneurs. But Republ icans in Congress blocked 
<br>other provisions that independent analysis said could create one million jobs. 
<br> 
<br>Even as President Obama remains committed to working with both part ies, he and his cabinet pursued a series of 
<br>executive actions to help spark economic growth and job creation, including expanding access to refinancing for 
<br>families who have stayed current on their mortgages, challenging Community Health Centers to hire veterans, 
<br>accelerating permitting for transportat ion projects, cutting waste and reducing improper payments, and enabling 
<br>student loan borrowers to cap their payments at a percentage of income. 
<br> 
<br>That’s why President Obama and the Democratic Party have cut taxes on American workers and businesses and 
<br>made sweeping reforms to the unemployment system to help get people back to work. 
<br> 
<br>And we continue to fight for measures that would strengthen the recovery and create jobs now, including keeping 
<br>teachers and first responders on the job, putting construction workers back to work by investing in our roads, bridges, 
<br>schools, and water supply, helping fam ilies refinance their mortgages and save hundreds of dollars a month, cutting 
<br>taxes for small businesses that invest and hire, and putting veterans back to work. That’s why we continue to fight for 
<br>relief for the long-term unemployed, including a ban on hiring discrimination against the unemployed and a reformed 
<br>and expanded universal worker training proposal to provide more training and job search assistance to all displaced 
<br>workers regardless of how they lost their job. The President’s plan includes many measures that have  long had 
<br>bipartisan support. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:7px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,BoldItalic; font-size:7px">The Middle Class Bargain 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Middle Class Tax Cuts.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> President Obama and Democrats in Congress cut taxes for every working family, putting 
<br>more money in the pockets of Americans who need it most. A typical family has saved $3,600 during his first term. 
<br>Now he’s fighting to stop middle class families and those aspiring to join the middle class from seeing their taxes go 
<br>up and to extend key tax relief for working families and those paying for college, while asking the wealthiest and 
<br>corporations to pay their fair share. That is why we will always vigorously oppose the type of tax reform supported by 
<br>Mitt Romney, which independent experts have found would require raising taxes on typical families with ch ildren by at 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">least $2,000 if it were paid for. At the same time, Mitt Romney’s plan would cut taxes  for those making over $3 million 
<br>by an average of $250,000 and would create incentives that will lead to hundreds of thousands of jobs going 
<br>overseas at the expense of American workers. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Health Care.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> We believe accessible, affordable, high quality health care is part of the American promise, that 
<br>Americans should have the security that comes with good health care, and that no one should go broke because they 
<br>get sick. Over the determined opposition of Republicans, we enacted landmark reforms that are already helping 
<br>millions of Americans, and more benefits will come soon. 
<br> 
<br>As a result of our efforts, today, young Americans entering the workforce can stay on their parents’ plans. Insurers 
<br>can no longer refuse to cover kids with pre-existing medical conditions. Insurance companies will no longer be able to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">arbitrarily cap and cancel coverage, or charge women more simply because of their gender. People with private 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">insurance are getting preventive services like cancer screenings, annual well-woman visits, and FDA-approved 
<br>contraception with no out-of-pocket costs. We’ve established new Offices of Minority Health, and are helping state 
<br>Medicaid programs fund home and community-based services. Small businesses are receiving tax credits to help 
<br>them cover their workers, and businesses and families are receiving rebates from insurers who overcharged them.

<br>bankruptcy if a family member gets sick or loses their job. And soon, insurance companies will no longer be able to 
<br>deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Medicaid will cover more working families. Those who don’t get 
<br>insurance at work will be able to shop in new exchanges and will be eligible for new tax credits. As a result, all 
<br>Americans will have access to health care. We heard powerful testimony before the platform drafting committee 
<br>about the difference it will make in Americans’ lives when, for the first time, 30 million of our fellow citizens finally gain 
<br>health insurance. 
<br> 
<br>Mitt Romney and the Republican Party would repeal health reform. They are more concerned with playing politics 
<br>than supporting families in this country. No law is perfect and Democrats stand willing to work with anyone to improve 
<br>the law where necessary, but we are committed to moving forward. We will continue to stand up to Repub licans 
<br>working to take away the benefits and protections that are already helping millions of Americans every day. We 
<br>refuse to go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your health policy, 
<br>deny you coverage, or charge women more than men.  
<br> 
<br>At the same time, the Affordable Care Act is not the end of efforts to improve health care for all  Americans. 
<br>Democrats will continue to fight for a strong health care workforce with an emphasis on primary care. We remain 
<br>committed to eliminating disparities in health and will continue to make sure families have access to mental health 
<br>and substance abuse services. We will strengthen Medicaid and oppose efforts to block grant the program, slash its 
<br>funding, and leave millions more without health  insurance. We will continue to invest in our public health infrastructure 
<br>– ensuring that we are able to respond to emergencies and support community-based efforts to prevent disease. The 
<br>Recovery Act and the health reform law made historic investments in Community Hea lth Centers, and Democrats will 
<br>continue to support these valuable institutions. We Democrats have increased overall funding to combat HIV/AIDS to 
<br>record levels and will continue our nation’s fight against HIV/AIDS. President Obama established the first-ever 
<br>comprehensive National HIV/AIDS Strategy for responding to the domestic epidemic, which calls for reducing HIV 
<br>incidence, increasing access to care, optimizing health outcomes, and reducing HIV-related health disparities. This is 
<br>an evidence-based plan that is guided by science and seeks to direct resources to the communities at greatest risk, 
<br>including gay men, black and Latino Americans, substance users, and others at high risk of infection. And we will 
<br>continue to support America’s groundbreaking biomedical researchers in their lifesaving work.

<br>that the health care law was going to make sure I could get a mammogram without any copay, I breathed a sigh of 
<br>relief. I knew I’d be able to keep on schedule and stay up to date on my breast cancer screenings. Then I had a 
<br>mammogram and found out I had a small tumor. Luckily, we caught it very early and I’m doing fine.”  – Judith Smith

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Stabilizing the Housing Market and Hard-Hit Communities</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">. For more than a decade, irresponsible lenders tricked 
<br>buyers into signing subprime loans while too many homeowners got in over their heads by buying homes they 
<br>couldn’t afford. But when the housing bubble burst, it hurt everyone, including responsible homeowners who played 
<br>by the rules, but saw their home values decline and their neighbors’ houses sit vacant. The housing market’s 
<br>dramatic collapse did more than punish millions of  innocent Americans; it also triggered the economy’s downward 
<br>spiral into recession.  
<br> 
<br>President Obama took swift action to stabilize a housing market in crisis, helping five million families restructure their 
<br>loans to help them stay in their homes, making it easier  for families to refinance their mortgages and save hundreds 
<br>of dollars a month, and giving tax credits to first-time home buyers. He also cracked down on fraudulent mortgage 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">lenders and other abuses that contributed to the housing crisis. Democrats have held the largest financial institutions 
<br>accountable by requiring them to provide relief for homeowners still struggling to pay their mortgages and to change 
<br>practices that took advantage of homeowners. Democrats also understand the importance of helping communities 
<br>fight back against the foreclosures that threaten entire neighborhoods, which is why the President proposed to 
<br>expand the successful neighborhood stabilization efforts in his American Jobs Act. 
<br> 
<br>Too many people still owe more on their homes than they are worth. Tha t is why Democrats are fighting to give every 
<br>responsible homeowner the chance to refinance their home, spurring investment in communities that have been hit 
<br>hardest by foreclosure, and taking whatever steps we can to avoid more  foreclosures. The President remains 
<br>committed to creating an economy that’s built to last, where home ownership is an achievable dream for all 
<br>Americans. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Social Security and Medicare.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> We believe every American deserves a secure, healthy, and dignified retirement. 
<br>America’s seniors have earned their Medicare and Social Security through a lifetime of hard work and personal 
<br>responsibility. President Obama is committed to preserving that promise for this and future generations. 
<br>

<div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:3491px; width:470px; height:639px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">During their working years, Americans contribute to Social Security in exchange for a promise that they will receive 
<br>an income in retirement. Unlike those in the other party,  we will find a solution to protect Social Security for future 
<br>generations. We will block Republican efforts to subject Americans’ guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the 
<br>stock market through privatization. We reject approaches that  insist that cutting benefits is the only answer. President 
<br>Obama will also make it easier for Americans to save on their own for retirement and prepare for unforeseen 
<br>expenses by participating in retirement accounts at work. 
<br> 
<br>The Republican budget plan would end Medicare as we know it. Democrats adamantly oppose any efforts to privatize 
<br>or voucherize Medicare; unlike our opponents we will not ask seniors to pay thousands of dollars more every year 
<br>while they watch the value of their Medicare benefits evaporate. Democrats believe that Medicare is a sacred 
<br>compact with our seniors. Nearly 50 million older Americans and Americans with disabilities rely on Medicare each 
<br>year, and the new health care law makes Medicare stronger by adding new benefits, fighting fraud, and improving 
<br>care for patients. And, over 10 years, the law will save the average Medicare beneficiary $4,200. President Obama is 
<br>already leading the most successful crackdown on health care fraud ever, having already recovered $10 billion from 
<br>health care scams. We will build on those reforms, not eliminate Medicare’s guarantees. The health care law is 
<br>closing the gap in prescription drug coverage known as the  “doughnut hole.” More than five million seniors have 
<br>already saved money – an average of $600 last year – and the doughnut hole will be closed for good by 2020. 
<br> 
<br>In short, Democrats believe that Social Security and Medicare must be kept strong for seniors, people with 
<br>disabilities, and future generations. Our opponents have shown a shocking willingness to gut these programs to pay 
<br>for tax cuts for the wealthiest, and we fundamentally reject that approach.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">An Economy that Out-Educates the World and Offers Greater Access to Higher Education and  
<br>Technical Training.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> Democrats believe that getting an education is the surest path to the middle class, giving all 
<br>students the opportunity to fulfill their dreams and contribute to our economy and democracy. Public education is one 
<br>of our critical democratic institutions. We are committed to ensuring that every child in America has access to a world-
<br>class public education so we can out-educate the world and make sure America has the world’s highest proportion of 
<br>college graduates by 2020. This requires excellence at every level of our education system, from early  learning 
<br>through post-secondary education. It means we must close the achievement gap in America’s schools and ensure 
<br>that in every neighborhood in the country, children can benefit from high-quality educational opportunities. 
<br> 
<br>This is why we have helped states and territories develop comprehensive plans to raise standards and  improve 
<br>instruction in their early learning programs and invested in expanding and reforming Head Start. 
<br> 
<br>President Obama and the Democrats are committed to working with  states and communities so they have the 
<br>flexibility and resources they need to improve elementary and secondary education in a way that works best for 
<br>students. To that end, the President challenged and encouraged states to raise the ir standards so students graduate 
<br>ready for college or career and can succeed in a dynamic global economy. Forty-six states responded, leading 
<br>groundbreaking reforms that will deliver better education to millions of American students. Too many students, 
<br>particularly students of color and disadvantaged students, drop out of our schools, and Democrats know we must 
<br>address the dropout crisis with the urgency it deserves. The Democratic Party understands the importance of turning 
<br>around struggling public schools. We will continue to strengthen all our schools and work to expand public school 
<br>options for low-income youth, including magnet schools, charter schools, teacher-led schools, and career academies. 
<br> 
<br>Because there is no substitute for a great teacher at the head of a classroom, the President helped school districts

<br> 
<br> We Democrats honor our nation’s teachers, who do a heroic job for their  students every day. If we want high-quality 
<br>education for all our kids, we must listen to the people who are on the front lines. The President has laid out a plan to 
<br>prevent more teacher layoffs while attracting and rewarding great teachers. This includes raising standards for the 
<br>programs that prepare our teachers, recognizing and rewarding good teaching, and retaining good teachers. We also 
<br>believe in carefully crafted evaluation systems that give struggling teachers a chance to succeed and protect due

<br>involvement in their child’s education. 
<br> 
<br>To help keep college within reach for every student, Democrats took on banks to reform our student loan program, 
<br>saving more than $60 billion by removing the banks acting as middlemen so we can better and more directly invest in 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">students. To make college affordable for students of all backgrounds and confront the loan burden our students 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">shoulder, we doubled our investment in Pell Grant scholarships and created the American Opportunity Tax Credit 
<br>worth up to $10,000 over four years of college, and we’re creating avenues for students to manage their federal 
<br>student loans so that their payments can be only 10 percent of what they make each month. President Obama has

<br>students, and continuing to ensure that students have access to federal loans with reasonable interest rates. We 
<br>invested more than $2.5 billion in savings  from reforming our student loan system to strengthen our nation’s 
<br>Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Alaska, 
<br>Hawaiian Native Institutions, Asian American and Pacific Islander Institutions, and other Minority Serving Institutions. 
<br>These schools play an important role  in creating a diverse workforce, educating new teachers, and produc ing the 
<br>next generation of STEM workers. 
<br> 
<br>We Democrats also recognize the economic opportunities created by our nation’s community colleges.  
<br>That is why the President has invested in community colleges and cal led for additional partnerships between 
<br>businesses and community colleges to train two m illion workers with the skills they need for good jobs waiting to be 
<br>filled, and to support business-labor apprenticeship programs that provide skills and opportunity to thousands of 
<br>Americans. The President also proposed to double key investments in science to educate the next generation of 
<br>scientists and engineers, encourage private sector innovation, and prepare at least 100,000 math and science 
<br>teachers over the next decade. And to make this country a destination for global talent and ingenuity, we won’t deport 
<br>deserving young people who are Americans in every way but on paper, and we will work to make it possible for 
<br>foreign students earning advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to stay and help 
<br>create jobs here at home. 
<br> 
<br>Mitt Romney has a radically different vision. He says we need fewer teachers, cops, and firefighters – good middle 
<br>class jobs – even after losing hundreds of thousands of such jobs during the recession and at a time when state, 
<br>local, and territorial governments are still shedding these jobs. He supports dramatic cuts to Head Start and the Pell 
<br>Grant program. Tuition at public colleges has soared over the last decade and students are graduating with more and 
<br>more debt; but Mitt Romney thinks students should “shop around” for the “best education they can afford.” And he 
<br>supports the radical House Republican budget that would cut financial aid for more than one million students while 
<br>giving tax cuts to the rich. We Democrats have focused on making sure that taxpayer dollars support high-quality 
<br>education programs, but Mitt Romney is a staunch supporter of expensive, for-profit schools – schools that often 
<br>leave students buried in debt and without the skills for quality jobs and that prey on our servicemembers and 
<br>veterans.

<br>Like so many people, I would have to put my education on hold. Because of President Obama, I don’t have to make 
<br>this sacrifice. By doubling Pell Grants and enacting college tax credits, he’s standing up for students and helping to

<br>need to create their own success, and President Obama understands that a quality STEM education is critical to my 
<br>students and to the economy of the future. That’s why he is challenging our country to support the work I do, and train

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">After the previous administration put two wars and tax cuts weighted towards the wealthy on the nation’s credit card, 
<br>and in the wake of the worst recession since the Great Depression, Democrats took decisive steps to restore fiscal 
<br>responsibility to Washington. We reinstated the tough pay-as-you-go budget rules of the 1990s so that all permanent 
<br>new spending and tax cuts must now be offset by savings or revenue increases. President Obama has already 
<br>signed into law $2 trillion in spending reductions as part of a balanced plan to reduce our deficits by over $4 trillion 
<br>over the next decade while taking immediate steps to strengthen the economy now. This approach includes tough 
<br>spending cuts that will bring annual domestic spending to its lowest level as a share of the economy in 50 years, 
<br>while still allowing us to make investments that benefit the middle class now and reduce our deficit over a decade. 
<br> 
<br>We are committed to defeating efforts that would return us to the failed economic policies of the past,  in which tax 
<br>relief for the wealthy explodes the deficit and asks the middle  class to shoulder that burden.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">To help spur economic growth, Pres ident Obama and the Democratic Party cut taxes for every working family – 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">providing $3,600 in tax relief to the typical family over the President’s first term in office – and we are committed to 
<br>extending the middle class tax cuts for the 98 percent of American families who make less than $250,000 a year, and 
<br>we will not raise taxes on them.

<br>clean energy, the President has asked for the wealthiest taxpayers to pay their fair share. We have to cut what we 
<br>don’t need in order to make room for the things we do need to grow our economy. We support allowing the Bush tax 
<br>cuts for the wealthiest to expire and closing loopholes and deductions for the largest corporations and the highest-
<br>earning taxpayers. We are committed to reforming our tax code so that it is fairer and simpler, creating a tax code 
<br>that lives up to the Buffett Rule so no millionaire pays a smaller share of his or her income in taxes than middle class 
<br>families do. We are also committed to reforming the corporate tax code to lower  tax rates for companies in the United 
<br>States, with additional relief for those locating manufacturing and research and development on our shores, while 
<br>closing loopholes and reducing incentives for corporations to shift jobs overseas. 
<br> 
<br>The Republican Party has a different vision—instead of asking everyone to do their fair share and making 
<br>investments we need for an economy built to last, they would slash  taxes for corporations and the wealthiest 
<br>Americans, let Wall Street once again write its own rules , and balance the budget on the backs of the middle class. 
<br>Romney and Congressional Republicans share the same, distorted view of the economy and support the same, 
<br>lopsided budget. Romney would roll back the tax relief Democrats provided to working families and college students, 
<br>and would require massive new taxes on the middle class to pay for his $5 trillion tax plan that primarily benefits the 
<br>wealthy. 
<br> 
<br>The Democratic Party opposes efforts to give additional tax cuts to  the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">All-of-the-Above Energy Policy</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">. In the last four years, President Obama and the Democratic Party have taken 
<br>concrete steps to make us more energy independent. We’ve supported nearly 225,000 clean energy jobs and 
<br>Americans are importing less oil, breathing cleaner air, and saving money on energy costs. Historic investments in 
<br>clean energy technologies have helped double the electricity we get from wind and solar. New emissions and fuel 
<br>efficiency standards for American cars are reducing our oil use, saving consumers at the pump, and putting 
<br>Americans back to work. Our dependence on foreign oil is now at a 16-year low, and a new era of cheap, abundant 
<br>natural gas is helping to bring jobs and  industry back to the United States. 
<br> 
<br>We can move towards a sustainable energy-independent future if we harness all of America’s great natural 
<br>resources. That means an all-of-the-above approach to developing America’s many energy resources, including 
<br>wind, solar, biofuels, geothermal, hydropower, nuclear, oil, clean coal, and natural gas. President Obama has 
<br>encouraged innovation to reach his goal of generating 80 percent of our electricity from clean energy sources by 
<br>2035. Democrats support making America the world’s leader in building a clean energy economy by extending clean 
<br>energy incentives that support American businesses and American jobs  in communities across the country. It’s not 
<br>enough to invent clean energy technologies here; we want to make them here and sell them around the world. We 
<br>can further cut our reliance on oil with increased energy efficiency in buildings, industry, and homes, and through the 
<br>promotion of advanced vehicles, fuel economy standards, and the greater use of natural gas in transportation. 
<br>Harnessing our natural gas resources needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner, which is why the Obama 
<br>administration has proposed a number of safeguards to protect against water contamination and air pollution. We will 
<br>continue to advocate for the use of this clean fossil fuel, while ensuring that public and environmental health and 
<br>workers’ safety are protected. We support more infrastructure investment to speed the transition to cleaner fuels in 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">the transportation sector. And we are expediting the approval process to build out critical oil and gas lines  essential to 
<br>transporting our energy for consumers. Building a clean energy future means that new exploration and production 
<br>needs to be approached safely and responsibly. Democrats are committed to balancing environmental protection with 
<br>development, and that means preserving sensitive public lands from exploration, like the Arctic National W ildlife 
<br>Refuge, Pacific West Coast, Gulf of Maine, and other irreplaceable national landscapes. 
<br> 
<br>We are saving consumers money on their energy bills – both at home and at the pump – but Republican energy 
<br>policy is full of empty rhetoric and bad ideas that would make their Big Oil donors even richer at the expense of the 
<br>middle class. Republicans would keep giving billions of taxpayer dollars a year to profitable oil companies and 
<br>increase costs on consumers. Democrats will fight to cut tax subsidies for Big Oil while promoting job growth in the 
<br>clean energy sector, so we can cut the deficit and increase  jobs and growth in America.

<br>recovery program, American manufacturers are creating jobs for  the first time since the 1990s,  including more than 
<br>500,000 jobs since the beginning of 2010. Instead of cutt ing jobs or shipping them abroad, many American 
<br>companies are now “insourcing,” or bringing overseas jobs back home.  
<br> 
<br>President Obama and the Democrats boldly rescued America’s auto industry, saving more than one million jobs, 
<br>preventing the collapse of the industry’s supply chain, and shoring up countless communities, while revitalizing the 
<br>backbone of America’s manufacturing sector. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">Mitt Romney thought the government’s action would destroy the auto industry; he and Republican  leaders opposed 
<br>the support President Obama extended to rescue an iconic industry.  
<br> 
<br>All three of America’s biggest auto manufacturers – Chrysler, GM, and Ford – are stronger today because of 
<br>President Obama’s decisive leadership. GM and Chrysler have repaid their outstanding loans years ahead of 
<br>schedule, new American cars are inspiring pride, and the auto industry added more than 200,000 jobs in the last 
<br>three years. 
<br> 
<br>At the same time, President Obama forged an agreement with Amer ican carmakers to nearly double fuel efficiency 
<br>standards in the coming years, changes that will save a typical car owner more than $8,000 in fuel costs over the life 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">of their vehicle and reduce American consumers’ fuel costs by almost $2 trillion. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>Today American carmakers and auto workers are helping to drive a st ronger recovery. The Democratic Party 
<br>supports a broad-based strategy to further strengthen an American renaissance in manufacturing, with tax relief for 
<br>clean energy manufacturing, incentives to create advanced vehicles in the United States, more research, and a 
<br>network of manufacturing innovation hubs. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:5px">“In early 2009, the auto industry was collapsing. Our plant shut down and I was laid off. And, like so many of us, I was 
<br>scared. But then President Obama bet on the American worker and rescued America’s auto industry, and it’s paying 
<br>off for our economy and our country. The plant opened its doors again, so I got my job – and my pride – back. That’s 
<br>a great American comeback story.” – Ina Sydney

<br>We want to cut tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and for special  interests, and instead offer 
<br>tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in the United States of America, betting on American workers 
<br>who are making American products we sell to the world that are stamped with three proud words: Made in America. 
<br> 
<br>Our strategy is paying off. After decades of watching American companies take jobs to other countries, we’re 
<br>beginning to see entrepreneurs and manufactures make the decision to keep factories and production facilities here 
<br>in the United States — and even bring jobs back from overseas. 
<br> 
<br>But the Republican Party has nominated a man whose firm invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing 
<br>– and whose plans would actually encourage outsourcing by eliminating all taxes on the foreign profits of U.S. 
<br>companies. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">There is more to do. We Democrats support lowering the corporate tax rate while closing unnecessary loopholes, and 
<br>lowering rates even further for manufacturers who create good jobs at home. We will give our businesses access to 
<br>newer roads and airports, and faster railroads and Internet access. We will fight for immediate investments for

<br>to 2007, we had the slowest private-sector job growth in an economic expansion since World War II. The typical 
<br>family saw its income stall and inequality climb, even as the economy grew. And we had an administration that 
<br>thought the answer was limiting unions. 
<br> 
<br>Upon taking office, President Obama began the work of restoring an economy built to last that creates good jobs that 
<br>pay well. Because the President and the Democratic Party believe in the right to organize and in supporting 
<br>America’s workers with strong labor laws, the Pres ident rolled back harmful labor policies designed to undermine 
<br>collective bargaining rights. The President appointed members of the National Labor Relations Board and National 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">Mediation Board who understand the importance of standing up for the rights of workers. He placed his bet on the 
<br>American worker when he rescued the auto industry. His administration will continue its fight against the exp loitative 
<br>practice of employers fraudulently misclassifying workers as independent contractors or white-collar workers to evade 
<br>taxes or deny them protections and overtime benefits. As new employment relationships evolve away from the 
<br>traditional employee-employer model, we need to make sure our labor laws are modernized and keep pace with 
<br>changes in our economy. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">The Republican Party would return us to the failed policies of the las t administration, vilifying the American worker,

<br>have created two out of three net new jobs. Democrats believe that small businesses are the engine of job growth in 
<br>America. President Obama signed 18 small-business tax cuts to encourage businesses to hire more workers and 
<br>make job-creating investments in machinery and equipment and proposed significant additional small business tax 
<br>relief. He encouraged investment and supported start-ups by allowing businesses to write off the full cost of new 
<br>equipment and machinery they bought in 2011. Altogether, the President’s Small Business Jobs Act accelerated $55 
<br>billion in tax relief through 2011. Democrats made it easier for small businesses to access the loans they needed to 
<br>grow and hire. The President signed into law changes to help entrepreneurs raise capital while maintaining key 
<br>investor protections. Small businesses are now once again creating jobs. Democrats have helped small businesses 
<br>provide health insurance to their workers with a tax credit to help pay for the cost of coverage. In 2014, the tax credit 
<br>will grow and small businesses will be able to pool their purchasing power together to get affordable coverage.  
<br> 
<br>We recognize the importance of small business to women, people of color , tribes, and rural America and will work to 
<br>help nurture entrepreneurship.  
<br> 
<br>President Obama and the Democratic Party are committed to cont inue cutting red tape for small businesses, helping 
<br>them sell their goods around the world and access the capital they need to grow. This  includes tax cuts for small 
<br>businesses that make new investments, hire more workers, or increase wages.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:5px">“When President Obama signed the Small Business Jobs Act two years ago, he made sure to guarantee some loans 
<br>to small businesses. That made it easier for people like me to get the credit needed to make it through the recession. 
<br>I got a loan from a local community bank and the Small Business Administration, which saved my business. I’m proud 
<br>that I didn’t lay off a single employee. This June, we’ll celebrate 40 years in business. When we do, we’ll be toasting 
<br>President Obama. The President looked out for small businesses because he knew that we – the creators of most of 
<br>the jobs in America – were struggling and in need of help.” – Peter Aaron

<br>goal of doubling our exports by 2015. We have taken steps to open new markets to American products, while 
<br>ensuring that other countries play by the same rules. President Obama signed into law new trade agreements with 
<br>South Korea, Colombia, and Panama that will support tens of thousands of private-sector jobs, but not before he 
<br>strengthened these agreements on behalf of American workers and businesses. We remain comm itted to finding

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>For too long, we’ve had a financial system that stacked the deck against ordinary Americans. Banks on Wall Street 
<br>played by different rules than businesses on Main Street and community banks. W ithout strong enough regulations, 
<br>families were enticed, and sometimes tricked, into buying homes they couldn’t afford. Banks and investors were 
<br>allowed to package and sell risky mortgages. Huge reckless bets were made with other people’s money on the line. 
<br> 
<br>That behavior not only nearly destroyed the financial system, it cost our  economy millions of jobs, hurt middle class 
<br>and poor families, and left taxpayers holding the bill.  
<br> 
<br>For the past three and a half years, President Obama and Democrats around the country have been fighting to bring 
<br>the country back from this historic economic crisis. We put in place Wall Street reform with smarter, tougher, 
<br>commonsense rules that will prevent a crisis like that from ever happening again. We know that the free market only 
<br>works when there are rules of the road to ensure that competition is fair, open, and honest. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">Mitt Romney and the Republicans would roll back financial reform and let Wall Street write its own rules again. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>The President put in place government reform that has led to the most open, efficient, and accountable government 
<br>in history. We know that transparent and effective government makes economic sense.  
<br> 
<br>Republicans would continue to allow lobbyists too much sway over lawmakers, leading to gridlock in Washington, an 
<br>outdated regulatory system, and a tax code riddled with  loopholes. The President put in place unprecedented ethics 
<br>reforms and we’re fighting for campaign finance reform. We know that millions of Americans are struggling to get by, 
<br>and their voices shouldn’t be drowned out by millions of dollars in secret special-interest lobbying and advertising. 
<br> 
<br>Mitt Romney’s opposition to commonsense campaign finance is nothing  less than support for corporate and special-
<br>interest takeovers in our elections. 
<br> 
<br>We believe America prospers when everyone, from Main Street to Wall St reet, does their fair share and plays by the 
<br>same rules. We will not back down from making sure an oil company can’t take the same reckless actions that led to 
<br>the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf of Mexico two years ago. We will not back down from protecting our kids from 
<br>toxic mercury pollution, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean. We will not back down from 
<br>ensuring that everyone has a seat at the American table and the opportunity to grab the first rung on the ladder to the 
<br>middle class.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,BoldItalic; font-size:7px">Wall Street Reform 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>A strong middle class can only exist in an economy where everyone plays by the same rules, from W all 
<br>Street to Main Street. That’s why President Obama and Democrats in Congress overcame fierce opposition from the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">financial industry to pass the most far-reaching Wall Street reform in generations. 
<br> 
<br>The failed policies of the past decade and hands-off approach toward the excesses of the financial  industry helped 
<br>create the deepest economic catastrophe since the Great Depression. In the fall of 2008, when the financial system 
<br>and economy were on the verge of catastrophic collapse, the last administration put in place the Troubled Asset 
<br>Relief Program. The Obama administration has ensured that big banks repay these loans with interest, and its 
<br>rigorous stewardship has brought transparency and accountability to the program. We enacted Wall Street reform to 
<br>end all future taxpayer-funded bank bailouts. 
<br> 
<br>Today Democrats are holding Wall Street accountable, bringing new transparency to financial markets, and ending 
<br>taxpayer-funded bank bailouts and the era of “too big to fail.” President Obama put in place new rules of the road that 
<br>refocus the financial sector on getting capital to entrepreneurs and small and mid-sized businesses who create jobs 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">and financing to millions of families who want to buy a home or send their kids to college. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>We’ve created a single consumer watchdog agency whose sole job is looking out for working families by protecting 
<br>them from deceptive and unfair lending practices of mortgage brokers, payday lenders, debt collectors, and other 
<br>financial institutions. Democrats are not only fighting to protect consumers from practices that can hurt their 
<br>pocketbooks and add to their debt, but also working to put an end to practices that helped cause the mortgage crisis.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>President Obama and the Democrats are committed to rethinking, reforming, and remaking our government so that it 
<br>can meet the challenges of our time. We reject the idea that we need to ask people to choose between their jobs and 
<br>their safety. We reject the argument that says for the economy  to grow, we have to roll back protections that ban 
<br>hidden fees by credit card companies, or rules that keep our kids from being exposed to mercury, or laws that prevent 
<br>the health insurance industry from shortchanging patients. Rules should be simpler and more flexible, and regulations 
<br>should be based on sound science and secure Americans’ freedom of choice. In our plat form hearing we heard about 
<br>the importance of a safety net that works, public schools that educate, and government that invests in a strong 
<br>economy. A 21st century regulatory system must promote economic growth,  innovation, and job creation while also 
<br>protecting public health and welfare. 
<br> 
<br>President Obama proposed a simpler, smarter, and more cost-effective approach to regulation, rather than one 
<br>riddled with special rules written by lobbyists. Efficient and effec tive regulations enforce common sense safeguards to 
<br>protect the American people. That’s what we’ve done in this country for more than a century. It’s why our food is safe 
<br>to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe. It’s why we put in place consumer protections against 
<br>hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis. That’s why  the 
<br>administration launched the Internet Privacy Bill of Rights and encouraged innovative solutions such as a Do Not 
<br>Track option for consumers. But there’s no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly. 
<br>That’s why President Obama asked all federal agencies to review and s treamline outdated regulations, an effort that 
<br>will save at least $10 billion over five years, and will elimina te tens of millions of hours in annual paperwork burdens. 
<br>That’s why he has approved fewer regulations  in the first three years of his presidency than his Republican 
<br>predecessor did in his. At the same time, those regulations have more than 25 times the net benefits of the previous 
<br>administration’s regulations. 
<br> 
<br>Looking to make our government leaner, smarter, and more consumer-friendly, President Obama has asked 
<br>Congress to reinstate the authority that past presidents had to reorganize and consolidate government agencies. 
<br>President Obama has also called for an ambitious, transparent, and unprecedented government-wide review of 
<br>existing federal regulations to eliminate unnecessary rules. In response, more than two dozen agencies have 
<br>released plans to streamline existing requirements. Just a small fraction of these initiatives will save billions of dollars 
<br>in the near future without sacrificing consumer protections, the environment, workplace safety, or health.  For too long, 
<br>overlapping responsibilities among agencies have made it harder, rather than easier, for our small businesses to 
<br>interact with their government. Where appropriate, we are also committed to working with states and U.S. territories 
<br>to support innovation in exchange for accountability and results. 
<br> 
<br>We are committed to the most open, eff icient, and accountable government in history, and we believe that 
<br>government is more accountable when it is transparent. This administration was the first to make  public the list of 
<br>visitors to the White House and create a centralized ethics and lobbying database available to the public online. 
<br>Democrats led the fight to enact the STOCK Act to ban congressional insider trading. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">President Obama launched the Open Government Initiative to empower the public – through greater openness and 
<br>new technologies – to influence the decisions that affect their lives. We are committed to using government as a 
<br>platform to spur innovation and collaboration. Forums such as Data.gov  release more information to the public so that 
<br>the private sector can pioneer innovative new  services.

<br>the sum of our individual actions; and that together, rather than divided, we can overcome the greatest challenges 
<br>that come our way. 
<br> 
<br>The path to restoring middle class security is through the basic values that made our country great. We are a nation 
<br>that says anyone can make it if you try – no matter who you are, where you come from, or what you look like. We 
<br>know that America is strongest when everybody has a seat at the table and when the same rules apply to everyone, 
<br>from Main Street to Wall Street.  
<br> 
<br>Republicans like Mitt Romney want to turn back the clock on the progress we’ve made, telling people whom they can 
<br>marry, restricting women’s access to birth control coverage, and going back to the same economic policies that 
<br>benefited the wealthy but crashed our economy. Their narrow vision is of an America where everyone is left to fend 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">for themselves and the powerful can write their own rules. Ours is a vision of a big, compassionate America where 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">everyone who works hard has the chance to get ahead – not just those already at the very top. It’s a vision that says 
<br>everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone engages in fair play. It’s a vision that says we 
<br>prosper when we realize that we are all in it together and stand united as a nation without dividing or excluding

<br>economic goals and reflects our values as both a nation of laws and a nation of  immigrants. The story of the United 
<br>States would not be possible without the generations of immigrants who have strengthened our country and 
<br>contributed to our economy. Our prosperity depends on an immigration system that reflects our values and meets 
<br>America’s needs. But Americans know that today, our immigration system is badly broken – separating families, 
<br>undermining honest employers and workers, burdening law enforcement, and leaving millions  of people working and 
<br>living in the shadows. 
<br> 
<br>Democrats know there is broad consensus to repair that system and strengthen our economy, and that the country 
<br>urgently needs comprehensive immigration reform that  brings undocumented immigrants out of the shadows and 
<br>requires them to get right with the law, learn English, and pay taxes in order to get on a path to earn citizenship. We 
<br>need an immigration reform that creates a system for allocating visas that meets our economic needs, keeps families 
<br>together, and enforces the law. But instead of promoting the national interest, Republicans have blocked immigration 
<br>reform in Congress and used the  issue as a political wedge. 
<br> 
<br>Despite the obstacles, President Obama has made important progress in implementing immigration policies that 
<br>reward hard work and demand personal responsibility. Today, the Southwest border is more secure than at any time 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">in the past 20 years. Unlawful crossings are at a 40-year low, and the Border Patrol is better staffed than at any time 
<br>in its history. We are continuing to work to hold employers accountable for whom they hire. The Department of 
<br>Homeland Security is prioritizing the deportation of criminals who endanger our communities over the deportation of 
<br>immigrants who do not pose a threat, such as children who came here through no fault of their own and are pursuing 
<br>an education. President Obama’s administration has streamlined the process of legal immigration for immediate 
<br>relatives of U.S. citizens, supporting family reunification as a priority, and has enhanced opportunities for English-
<br>language learning and immigrant integration. When states sought to interfere with federal immigration law by passing 
<br>local measures targeting immigrants, this administration challenged them  in court. 
<br> 
<br>President Obama and the Democrats fought for the DREAM Act, legislation ensuring that young people who want to 
<br>contribute fully to our society and serve our country are able to become legal residents and ultimately citizens. 
<br>Although this bill has a long history of bipartisan support, Republicans decided to play politics with it rather than do 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">the right thing. So the Obama administration provided temporary relief for youth who came to the

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">and the Wounded Warrior Tax Credit to give companies incentives to hire vets. That’s why we have committed to 
<br>ending veterans’ homelessness by 2015, and have launched new partnerships with the Departments of Veterans 
<br>Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and with veterans’ organizations to do just that. That’s why, because 
<br>the traumas of war don’t always end when our loved ones return home, this administration  is continuing to work to 
<br>meet the mental health needs of our veterans. That's why we will continue to partner with the nation's Veterans 
<br>Service Organizations and veterans advocacy groups to ensure that every veteran of every generation receives the 
<br>care and benefits they've earned. That’s why we have made it easier for veterans  in rural communities to get the care 
<br>they need. And it is why we have substantially increased funding for the VA, and directed it to  eliminate its backlog of 
<br>claims, hire additional claims processors, and deploy new systems to improve claims processing times.

President Obama and the 
<br>Democratic Party will continue to lead efforts to facilita te the access of Americans with disabilities to the middle class, 
<br>employment opportunities, and the ability to lead full, productive, and satisfying lives. The administration and the 
<br>Democratic Party are committed to assisting the approximately 50 million people in this country living with disabilities, 
<br>assuring their full integration into society. 
<br> 
<br>This administration has committed to hiring 100,000 Americans with disabilities within the federal government by 
<br>2015, and has proposed new rules to create employment opportunities with federal contractors. We are committed to 
<br>expanding access to employment for people with disabilities and removing barriers to work. The Affordable Care Act 
<br>is opening access to health insurance to Americans with disabilities who were previously excluded because of pre-
<br>existing conditions, expanding access to Medicaid, and helping Medicaid to support home- and community-based 
<br>services to keep people in their communities. Further, the President issued an executive order repealing the 
<br>restrictions on embryonic stem cell research and signed into law the Christopher and Dana Reeves Paralysis Act, the 
<br>first piece of comprehensive legislation aimed at improving the lives of Americans living with paralysis. Democrats are 
<br>committed to ensuring that Americans with disabilities can exercise their right to vote and have access to the polls. 
<br>We will continue to oppose all efforts to weaken the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act, and we will vigorously 
<br>enforce laws that prevent discrimination. And the President and the Democratic Party will fiercely oppose the harsh 
<br>cuts in Medicaid that would inevitably lead to no or significantly less health care for millions of Americans with 
<br>disabilities, workers with disabilities, and families raising children with autism, Down Syndrome, and other serious 
<br>disabilities.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Faith.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> Faith has always been a central part of the American story, and it has been a driving force of progress and 
<br>justice throughout our history. We know that our nation, our communities, and our lives are made vastly stronger and 
<br>richer by faith and the countless acts of justice and mercy it inspires. Faith-based organizations will always be critical 
<br>allies in meeting the challenges that face our nat ion and our world – from domestic and global poverty, to climate 
<br>change and human trafficking. People of faith and religious organizations do amazing work in communities across 
<br>this country and the world, and we believe in lifting up and valuing that good work, and finding ways to support it 
<br>where possible. We believe in constitutionally sound, evidence-based partnerships with faith-based and other non-
<br>profit organizations to serve those in need and advance our shared interests. There is no conflict between  supporting 
<br>faith-based institutions and respecting our Constitution, and a full commitment to both principles is essential for the 
<br>continued flourishing of both faith and country.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Rural Communities and Agriculture.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> We are committed to creating a rural economy built to last – one focused on 
<br>reclaiming the security of the rural middle class by growing the food, fiber, and fuel that the rest of the world buys and 
<br>restoring the basic values of hard work and  fair play that made our country great. By investing in job creation, clean 
<br>energy, agriculture, and education, Democrats have built a stronger rural economy where future generations can 
<br>enjoy the rural way of life. 
<br> 
<br>President Obama and Democrats in Congress have worked to extend credit to a record number of small business 
<br>owners, boosting economic growth in rural America. We support a clean energy economy that  is creating jobs and 
<br>helping lower energy costs in rural America. U.S. biofuel production is at its highest  level in history. We have made 
<br>historic investments in renewable fuels and expanded markets for them. 
<br> 
<br>We support strengthening rural water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure to make rural businesses more 
<br>competitive. We have expanded broadband access to nearly seven million rural Americans,  including rural 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">businesses, creating new jobs. We have invested in  water and wastewater community  infrastructure projects, 
<br>safeguarding the health of 18 million rural residents and creating even more jobs. Democrats will strengthen the 
<br>American farm safety net by renewing crop disaster relief, maintaining strong crop insurance programs, and creating 
<br>a permanent disaster relief program. We will improve access to education and health care, especially for rural 
<br>veterans, and conserve millions of acres of public lands while supporting rural recreation and tourism. 
<br> 
<br>Our vision for rural America stands in stark contrast to our opponents ’. Republicans in Congress have introduced a 
<br>budget that would gut rural economic programs that invest in education, clean energy,  infrastructure, and health care, 
<br>undermining job growth and economic development in rural America. They would severely weaken the farm safety 
<br>net for family farmers in times of natural disaster and economic hardship.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">energy supply, and the security of America’s middle class. Democrats support agriculture from the small farms that 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">feed the community to the large farms that feed the world. Under President Obama, American farmers are seeing 
<br>record farm income, record agricultural exports, and millions of acres enrolled in conservation programs. President

<br>out of every 12 American jobs. 
<br> 
<br>Democrats appreciate agriculture’s role in securing America’s food security and making our coun try an ambassador 
<br>of food aid to countries across the world. That’s why Democrats support a strong farm safety net, with increased 
<br>availability of crop insurance and emergency disaster assistance to help farmers and ranchers keep their farms in 
<br>business after natural disasters and crop loss. Democrats are also planning for a strong agricultural future, and 
<br>President Obama has proposed increasing funding for research and development to improve agricultural productivity 
<br>and continue to pursue global food security.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Tribal Sovereignty.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are sovereign self-governing communities, with a 
<br>unique government-to-government relationship with the United States. President Obama and Democrats in 
<br>Congress, working with tribes, have taken unprecedented steps to resolve long-standing conflicts, finally coming to a 
<br>resolution on litigation – some dating back nearly 100 years – related to management of Indian trust resources, 
<br>administration of loan programs, and water rights. 
<br> 
<br>The President worked with Democrats to pass the HEARTH Act to promote g reater tribal self-determination and 
<br>create jobs in Indian Country. The Affordable Care Act permanently reauthorized the Indian Health Care 
<br>Improvement Act to improve care for Native Americans. Democrats enacted the Tribal Law and Order Act, support 
<br>expansion of the Violence Against Women Act to include greater protection for women on tribal lands, and oppose 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">versions of the Violence Against Women Act that do not include these critical provisions. We will continue to honor 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">our treaty and trust obligations and respect cultural rights, including greater support for American Indian and Alaska 
<br>Native languages. Democrats support maximizing tribal self-governance, including efforts for self-determination and 
<br>sovereignty of Native Hawaiians.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Puerto Rico.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> As President Obama said when he became the first President to visit Puerto Rico and address its 
<br>people in 50 years, </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:5px">Boricuas </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">every day help write the American story. Puerto Ricans have been proud American 
<br>citizens for almost 100 years. During that time,  the people of Puerto Rico have developed strong political, economic, 
<br>social, and cultural ties to the United States. The political status of Puerto Rico remains an issue of overwhelming 
<br>importance, but lack of resolution about status has held the island back. It is time for Puerto Rico to take the next step 
<br>in the history of its status and its relationship to the rest of the United States. 
<br> 
<br>The White House Task Force Report on Puerto Rico has taken important and historic steps regarding status. We 
<br>commit to moving resolution of the status issue forward with the goal of resolving it expeditiously. If local efforts in 
<br>Puerto Rico to resolve the status issue do not provide a c lear result in the short term, the President should support, 
<br>and Congress should enact, self-executing legislation that specifies in advance for the people of Puerto Rico a set of 
<br>clear status options, such as those recommended in the White House Task Force Report on Puerto Rico, which the 
<br>United States is politically committed to fulfilling. 
<br> 
<br>The economic success of Puerto Rico is intimately linked to a swift resolution of the status question, as  well as 
<br>consistent, focused efforts on improving the lives of the peop le of Puerto Rico. We have made great progress for 
<br>Puerto Rico over the past four years, including a sharp, historic increase in Medicaid funding for the people of Puerto 
<br>Rico and fair and equitable inclus ion in the Recovery Act and the Affordable Care Act. Going forward, we will 
<br>continue working toward fair and equitable participation for Puerto Rico in federal programs. We support increased 
<br>efforts by the federal government to improve public safety in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, with a 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">particular emphasis on efforts to combat drug trafficking and crime throughout our Caribbean border. In add ition, 
<br>consistent with the task force report, we will continue to work on improving Puerto Rico’s economic status by 
<br>promoting job creation, education, health care, clean energy, and economic development on the Island.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Guam, American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands and the Commonwealth of  the Northern Mariana Islands.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> We also 
<br>recognize and honor the contributions and the sacrifices made in service of our country by the Americans living in the 
<br>territories of Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
<br>Islands. We support full self-government and self-determination for the people of the territories, and their right to 
<br>decide their future status. We will work as partners to the people of Guam on military matters, and take seriously the 
<br>unique health care challenges that Pacific Island communities face. For all those who live under our flag, we support 
<br>strong economic development and will work towards fair and equitable treatment under federal programs.

<br>rules. At the core of the Democratic Party is the pr inciple that no one should face discrimination on the basis of race, 
<br>ethnicity, national origin, language, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability status. Democrats 
<br>support our civil rights statutes and we have stepped up enforcement of laws that prohibit discrimination in the 
<br>workplace and other settings. We are committed to protecting all communities from violence. We are committed to 
<br>ending racial, ethnic, and religious profiling and requiring federal, state, and local enforcement agencies to take steps 
<br>to eliminate the practice, and we continue to support enforcement of Title VI. 
<br> 
<br>We are committed to equal opportunity for all Americans and to making sure that every American is treated equally 
<br>under the law. We are committed to ensuring full equality for women: we reaffirm our support for the Equal Rights 
<br>Amendment, recommit to enforcing Title IX, support the Paycheck Fairness Act, and will urge ratification of the 
<br>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. 
<br> 
<br>We know that putting America back to work is Job One, and we are committed to ensuring that Americans do not 
<br>face employment discrimination. We support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act because people should not be 
<br>fired based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. 
<br> 
<br>President Obama and the Democratic Party are committed to ensuring all Americans are treated fairly. This 
<br>administration hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Bullying Prevention and we must continue our work 
<br>to prevent vicious bullying of young people and support LGBT youth. The President’s record, from ending “Don’t Ask, 
<br>Don’t Tell” in full cooperation with our military leadership, to passing the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate 
<br>Crimes Prevention Act, to ensuring same-sex couples can visit each other in the hospital, reflects Democrats’ belief 
<br>that all Americans deserve the same chance to pursue happiness, earn a  living, be safe in their communities, serve 
<br>their country, and take care of the ones  they love. The Administration has said that the word ‘family’ in immigration 
<br>includes LGBT relationships in order to protect bi-national families threatened with deportation.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:5px">“Because of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’ each time I went off to war, no one was at the armory to say goodbye. No one 
<br>was waiting at the airport when I returned. My partner, George Di Salvo, and I started a family five years  ago by 
<br>adopting two wonderful boys. But I kept their existence secret, because that’s what the law required. Not anymore, 
<br>however. Thanks to the unyielding efforts of President Obama, I can serve my country openly and proudly with my 
<br>family by my side.” – Dr. Vito Imbasciani, Colonel, California National Guard, Medical Service Corps

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Women.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> President Obama – the son of a single mother and the father of two daughters – understands that women 
<br>aren’t a special interest group. They are more than half of this country, and issues that affect women also affect 
<br>families. That is why the first bill he signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which helps women fight 
<br>back when they are paid less than men, and why we continue to fight to overcome Republican opposition and pass 
<br>the Paycheck Fairness Act to help stop gender discrimination in pay before it starts. And that is why the Justice 
<br>Department and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, led by President Obama’s appointees, have 
<br>investigated and prosecuted numerous violations of the nation’s civil rights laws, and obtained more than $140 m illion 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">in relief for victims of gender discrimination. We Democrats will continue to support efforts to ensure that workers can 
<br>combat gender discrimination in the workplace and to protect women against pregnancy discrimination. And that’s 
<br>why we support passing the Healthy Families Act, broadening the Family and Medical Leave Act, and partnering with 
<br>states to move toward paid leave. 
<br> 
<br>We understand that economic issues are women’s issues, and the challenges of supporting and raising a family are 
<br>often primarily a woman’s responsibility. That’s why putting Americans back to work is Job One. That’s why the 
<br>Affordable Care Act especially helps women by guaranteeing they and their families won’t become uninsured when 
<br>they lose their jobs. That’s why this administration strengthened Medicare and Medicaid for millions of women and 
<br>families. And that’s why the Affordable Care Act is ending health insurance discrimination against women, and 
<br>provides women with free access to preventive care,  including prenatal screenings, mammograms, cervical cancer

<br>I also know firsthand that President Obama takes these issues seriously: the first bill that he signed into law was 
<br>focused on making sure that other women don’t face the same injustice. While the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act won’t

<br>ability to pay. We oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right. Abortion is an intensely personal 
<br>decision between a woman, her family, her doctor, and her clergy; there is no place for politicians or government to 
<br>get in the way. We also recognize that health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies 
<br>and thereby also reduce the need for abortions. We strongly and unequivocally support a woman’s decision to have a 
<br>child by providing affordable health care and ensuring the availability of and access to programs that help women

<br>history of standing up for the right to vote. During the Obama  administration, the Justice Department has init iated 
<br>careful, thorough, and independent reviews of proposed voting changes, and it has prevented states from 
<br>implementing voter identification laws that would be harmful to minority voters. Democrats know that voter 
<br>identification laws can disproportionately burden young voters, people of color, low-income families, people with 
<br>disabilities, and the elderly, and we refuse to allow the use of political pretexts to disenfranchise American citizens.

<br> 
<br>We oppose discriminatory federal and state constitutional amendments and other attempts to deny equal protection

<br>is subject to reasonable regulation. We understand the terrible consequences of gun violence; it serves as a reminder 
<br>that life is fragile, and our time here is limited and precious. We believe in an honest, open national conversation 
<br>about firearms. We can focus on effective enforcement of existing laws, especially strengthening our background 
<br>check system, and we can work together to enact commonsense improvements – like reinstating the assault

<br>communities around the country. 
<br> 
<br>When President Obama first took office, four  in five cities had already cut services at a time when American people 
<br>needed them most, while 48 states faced the prospect of budget deficits in the next fiscal year. We took swift and 
<br>aggressive action in the first months of  this administration to pull cities back from the brink, preventing our local 
<br>communities from sinking into deeper holes and being forced to lay off tens of thousands of police officers, 
<br>firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and teachers. This administration is  implementing the Neighborhood 
<br>Revitalization Initiative to combat poverty in American cities and the Sustainable Communities 
<br>Initiative, supports the proposed Growth Zone Initiatives, and has  invested in green jobs training programs, 
<br>community development, public and affordable housing, and homelessness prevention to cut red tape and help 
<br>revitalize American cities. The administration knows one size does not fit all, which is why it has listened to city 
<br>leaders about what they need most and is fostering ground-up, instead of top-down, solutions by assigning federal 
<br>workers to work side-by-side with local leaders in struggling cities. 
<br> 
<br>President Obama and Democrats in Congress have enacted infrastructure investments that will sustain our Highway 
<br>Trust Fund and provide states, U.S. territories, and commun ities with two years of funding to build needed roads, 
<br>bridges, and transit systems. We will continue to partner with local communities to support their sustainable 
<br>developments such as passenger rail, bicycle and pedestrian paths, and other projects to support livable cities. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:5px">“America’s metro areas - cities and suburbs working in partnership - are home to 86 percent of the nation’s jobs. In 
<br>this economic environment, our nation's mayors call for a renewed investment in our metro economies. President 
<br>Obama and the Democratic Party have already worked hard toward this promise, including the over $100 billion of 
<br>infrastructure investment as part of the Recovery Act, because investment in infrastructure, education, workforce 
<br>training, and public safety will support job creation, fos ter innovation, and provide companies with a globally 
<br>competitive workforce. The generations who came before us built our great nation by investing in the future. We must

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Poverty.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> Too many Americans live without hope for a better future or access to good, family-supporting jobs. Fifteen 
<br>percent of our fellow citizens live in poverty, and one in five families struggles with food  insecurity. Many of these 
<br>families work but are unable to pay the bills. The economic crisis has hit low -income American families particularly 
<br>hard, but merely restoring our country to where it was before the economic crisis is not enough. We must make 
<br>ending poverty a national priority. 
<br> 
<br>When the President took office, we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month. President Obama and 
<br>Democrats took immediate action to get the economy moving again. By expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit 
<br>and the Child Tax Credit, and supporting unemployment insurance benefits and food stamps, the Recovery Act kept 
<br>seven million people out of poverty and reduced poverty for 32 million more in 2010. The Obama administration 
<br>invested in Promise Neighborhoods in communities across the country – a comprehensive approach to fighting 
<br>poverty from early learning to college and career. The administration provided grants to financial institutions in urban 
<br>and rural communities for the purpose of increasing lending for low-income Americans. 
<br> 
<br>But there is still more work to do. Democrats believe that we must raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation. 
<br>We will continue to fight for equal pay for equal work, a st rong labor movement, and access  to a world-class 
<br>education for every child. We will help lift people with disabilit ies out of poverty. We understand that poverty 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">disproportionately affects communities of color and we are committed to working with those most affected by poverty. 
<br>We will continue the improvements in refundable tax credits for low-income families to encourage work and education 
<br>while lifting families out of poverty. To enhance access and equity in employment, education, and business 
<br>opportunities, we encourage initiatives to remove barriers to equal opportunity that still exist in Amer ica. We will 
<br>expand the Promise Neighborhoods Program to prepare more students for college. 
<br> 
<br>We face an opposition that has proven its priorities are elsewhere. Mitt Romney would raise taxes on  low- and 
<br>middle-income Americans to fund his tax breaks weighted toward the wealthiest. We reject the Republican budget 
<br>plan that would force us to destroy the safety net  in order to help the wealthiest avoid doing their fair share.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Public Safety, Justice, and Crime Prevention</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">. In the last four years, rates of serious crimes, like murder, rape, and 
<br>robbery, have reached 50-year lows, but there is more work to do. President Obama and Democrats are fighting for 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">new funding that will help keep cops on the street and support our police, firefighters, and emergency medical 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">technicians. Republicans and Mitt Romney have opposed and even ridiculed these proposals, but we believe we 
<br>should support our first responders. We support efforts to ensure our courageous police officers and first responders 
<br>are equipped with the best technology, equipment, and innovative strategies to prevent and fight crimes.

<br>based law enforcement programs such as the Community Oriented Policing Services program. We will reduce 
<br>recidivism in our neighborhoods. We created the Federal Interagency Reentry Council in 2011, but there’s more to be 
<br>done. We support local prison-to-work programs and other initiatives to reduce recidivism, making citizens safer and 
<br>saving the taxpayers money. We understand the disproportionate effects of crime, violence, and incarceration on 
<br>communities of color and are committed to working with those communities to find solutions. 
<br> 
<br>We will continue to fight inequalities in our criminal justice system. We believe that the death penalty must not be 
<br>arbitrary. DNA testing should be used in all appropriate circumstances, defendants should have effective assistance 
<br>of counsel, and the administration of justice should be fair and impartial. That’s why we enacted the Fair Sentencing 
<br>Act, reducing racial disparities in sentencing for drug crimes. That’s why President Obama appointed two 
<br>distinguished jurists to the Supreme Court: Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. Moving forward, we will 
<br>continue to nominate and confirm judges who are men and women of unquestionable talent and character and will 
<br>always demonstrate their faithfulness to our law and our Constitution and bring with them a sense of how American 
<br>society works and how the American people live. 
<br> 
<br>We must help state, local, territorial, and tribal law enforcement work together to combat and prevent drug crime and 
<br>drug and alcohol abuse, which are blights on our communities. We have increased funding for the Byrne Justice 
<br>Assistance Grant Program over the last four years, and we will continue to expand the use of drug courts. We support 
<br>the rights of victims to be respected, heard, and compensated. 
<br> 
<br>We are committed to ending violence against women. We support reauthorizing the bipartisan Violence Against 
<br>Women Act and oppose the proposals by Republicans in the House of Representatives that would undermine this 
<br>law and deprive law enforcement of the tools it needs to combat violence against women.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Service, Volunteerism, and Social Innovation.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> President Obama has called on all Americans to participate in our 
<br>nation’s renewal by serving in our communities. The Democratic Party believes, as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. did, 
<br>that everybody can be great because everybody can serve. The challenges America faces are unprecedented and 
<br>the new foundation for economic growth we need in America will not be built by Washington alone – it’s going to take 
<br>all of us, working together. To this end, Democrats enacted the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, increasing 
<br>the size of AmeriCorps and creating more opportunities for Americans of all ages to serve their communities. 
<br>President Obama and the Democrats in Congress have also sought to increase the budget for the Peace Corps, and 
<br>today VISTA is larger, stronger, and more vital than it has ever been. 
<br> 
<br>We believe solutions to America’s challenges are being developed every day at  the grassroots level, and government 
<br>should be supporting those efforts. We’ve created a Social Innovation Fund that is leveraging millions in private 
<br>sector dollars to invest in programs with a proven track record of success. Our nation is experiencing some of the 
<br>greatest challenges in a generation, but it is also a time of great opportunity if we come together as a community.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Environment.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> Democrats are committed to protecting our natural resources while creating jobs, preserving habitats, 
<br>and ensuring that future generations can enjoy our nation’s outdoor heritage. From  investing in clean energy to 
<br>protecting our air, land, and water, Democrats have made protecting the environment a top priority. Today we are 
<br>responsibly developing our natural resources to create clean energy jobs here at home while encouraging 
<br>conservation, reducing energy waste, and protecting the environment. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">President Obama has taken the most significant strides in decades to cut pollution and advance public health – 
<br>protecting our children and communities from harmful pollution by restoring and advancing safeguards for clean air 
<br>and water and by working to reduce carbon pollution. Pollutants like nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, 
<br>and mercury are a threat to human health, and Democrats will continue to stand up to polluters in the interest of 
<br>environmental and public health. 
<br> 
<br>We know that global climate change is one of the biggest threats of  this generation – an economic, environmental, 
<br>and national security catastrophe in the making. We affirm  the science of climate change, commit to significantly 
<br>reducing the pollution that causes climate change, and know we have to meet this challenge by driving smart policies 
<br>that lead to greater growth in clean energy generation and result in a range of economic and social benefits. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">President Obama has been a leader on this issue. We have developed historic fuel efficiency standards that will limit

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">energy, and proposed the first-ever carbon pollution limits for new fossil-fuel-fired power plants. As we move towards 
<br>lower carbon emissions, we will continue to support smart, energy efficient manufacturing. Democrats pledge to 
<br>continue showing international leadership on climate change, working toward an agreement to set emission limits in 
<br>unison with other emerging powers. Democrats will continue pursuing efforts to combat climate change at home as

<br>continue being an international leader on this issue. We understand that global climate change may 
<br>disproportionately affect the poor, and we are committed to environmental justice. 
<br> 
<br>We are restoring treasured landscapes like the Great Lakes, the Florida Everglades, and local wilderness areas. We 
<br>are working with Gulf Coast states to restore the Gulf and hold BP and other responsible parties accountable. 
<br>Democrats will continue to work with local communities to conserve our publicly-owned lands and dramatically 
<br>expand investments in conserving and restoring forests, grasslands, and wetlands across America for generations to 
<br>come. We will ensure that our National Parks are protected while expanding opportunities for Americans to visit and 
<br>experience these national treasures. Democrats will continue working to ensure the integrity of the waters Americans 
<br>rely on every day for drinking, swimming, and fishing, by supporting initiatives that restore our rivers, oceans, coasts, 
<br>and watersheds. We will preserve landscapes and ecosystems and open more lands and waters for hunting, fishing, 
<br>and recreation. This will bolster local economies and is good for communities today and for generations to come.  
<br> 
<br>Our opponents have moved so far to the right as to doubt the science of climate change, advocate the selling of our 
<br>federal lands, and threaten to roll back environmental protections that safeguard public health. Their leaders deny the 
<br>benefits of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts – benefits like job creation, health, and the prevention of tens of 
<br>thousands of premature deaths each year. They ignore the jobs that are created by promoting outdoor recreation, 
<br>cleaning up our air, and promoting a healthy environment.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>When President Obama took office in January 2009, our armed forces were engaged in two wars. Al-Qaeda, which 
<br>had attacked us on 9/11, remained entrenched in its safe havens. Many of our alliances were strained, and our 
<br>standing in the world had diminished. Around the world and here at home, there were those who questioned whether 
<br>the United States was headed toward inevitable decline. 
<br> 
<br>Under the leadership of President Obama and the Democratic Party, the tide of war is now receding, and America is 
<br>looking ahead to a new future. We have responsibly ended the war in Iraq. We have struck major blows against al-
<br>Qaeda, bringing Osama bin Laden and other senior al-Qaeda leaders to justice, and putting the terrorist organization 
<br>on the path to defeat. And we have reversed the momentum of the Taliban and established the conditions to draw 
<br>down our forces in Afghanistan. 
<br> 
<br>These actions have enabled a broader strategic rebalancing of American foreign policy. After more than a decade at 
<br>war, we can focus on nation-building here at home and concentrate our resources and attention abroad on the areas 
<br>that are the greatest priority moving forward. This means directing more energy toward crucial problems, including 
<br>longstanding threats like nuclear proliferation and emerging dangers such as cyber attacks, biological weapons, 
<br>climate change, and transnational crime. And it means a long-overdue focus on the world’s most dynamic regions 
<br>and rising centers of influence. 
<br> 
<br>As we rebalance our foreign policy, we have rebuilt our relationships around the world. From Europe and Asia to the 
<br>Middle East, Africa, and the Americas, we have strengthened the alliances and partnerships that are so central to 
<br>global security, and we have taken steps to reinvigorate international institutions. All the while, we have built the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">foundation for sustained American leadership by growing our economy, preserving our unrivaled military strength, 
<br>and advancing our values. 
<br> 
<br>President Obama and the Democratic Party know that there is no greater responsibility than protecting the American 
<br>people. We also understand the indispensable role that the United States must continue to play in promoting 
<br>international peace and prosperity. And because of the steps we have taken, the United States is leading once again, 
<br>and America is safer, stronger, and more secure than it was four years ago.

<br>Charting a responsible path out of the war in Iraq has been a crucial element of President Obama’s foreign policy and 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">has enabled important shifts in our broader strategy.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>Then-Senator Obama pledged during the 2008 campaign to responsibly end the war in Iraq, saying it was imperative 
<br>to “be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in” – and that is precisely what he has done. For over half a 
<br>decade, our focus on Iraq meant we had taken our eye off of al-Qaeda, and it had cost us thousands of lives, a trillion 
<br>dollars, and severely strained our key alliances. When President Obama took office, there were over 140,000

<br>there either. The Iraqi people, in continued partnership with the United States, now have the opportunity to build a 
<br>better future. 
<br> 
<br>After taking office, President Obama removed our combat brigades and ended our combat mission on a 19-month 
<br>timetable. And after an interim period in which we continued to advise Iraqis and conduct counterterrorism operations, 
<br>we completed the drawdown of all U.S. troops last December. This decision was reached after extensive discussions 
<br>and with the full agreement of the Iraqi government, and it was determined  to be in the best interest of both nations. 
<br>Many Republicans, including Mitt Romney, would have preferred to leave tens of thousands of U.S. troops in Iraq in 
<br>an open-ended commitment, against the will of the Iraqi government and people. 
<br> 
<br>Moving forward, President Obama and the Democratic Party are committed  to building a robust, long-term strategic 
<br>partnership with a sovereign, united, and democratic Iraq in all fields – diplomatic, economic, and security – based on 
<br>mutual interests and mutual respect.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:5px">“As Commander-in-Chief, President Obama has proven willing to use military force when necessary, though he also 
<br>knows how important it is for force to be used as a last resort. He is a strong and responsible leader who has kept his

<br>President signed tax credits into  law for businesses that hire veterans and wounded warriors. He supported the Post -

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>President Obama and the Democratic Party understood that the war in Iraq distracted us from confronting many of 
<br>the most fundamental national security challenges facing the United States,  including the danger posed by 
<br>international terrorist organizations that threaten the American homeland. As the Bush administration shifted its focus 
<br>to Iraq, Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda established safe havens across the border from Afghanistan, in Pakistan. 
<br>President Obama’s decision to end the Iraq war freed up military and intelligence resources to refocus on this fight 
<br>and enabled us to shift to a much more effective approach to counterterrorism. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:5px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">Importantly, President Obama also shifted away from the Bush administration’s sweeping and  internationally-divisive 
<br>rhetoric of a “global war on terrorism” to a more focused effort against an  identifiable network of people: al-Qaeda and 
<br>its affiliates. That has allowed us to target force with greater precision against those who want to harm Americans and 
<br>attack the United States and move away from the type of large-scale military deployments characteristic of  the 
<br>previous administration and favored by many Republicans today. 
<br> 
<br>As a candidate, then-Senator Obama committed to bringing Osama bin Laden to justice , even if that meant crossing 
<br>the border into Pakistan. As a consequence of the Pres ident’s decisions and the brave work of our military and 
<br>intelligence professionals, bin Laden can no longer threaten the United States and al-Qaeda’s senior leadership has 
<br>been devastated, rendering the group far less capable than it was four years ago. The al-Qaeda core in Afghanistan 
<br>and Pakistan has never been weaker. We have also struck blows against al-Qaeda’s leadership in Yemen and 
<br>Somalia – with the full support and close cooperation of those governments. At the same time, the President and  the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">Democratic Party understand that we must stay vigilant. The al-Qaeda core may be on the path to defeat, but the 
<br>organization and its affiliates remain active in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and elsewhere. For that 
<br>reason, we are committed to an unrelenting pursuit of those who would kill Americans or threaten our homeland, our 
<br>allies, our partners, and our interests around the world.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>The United States went into Afghanistan after 9/11 to bring justice to those who had attacked us and to  take away al-
<br>Qaeda’s safe haven. But by the time President Obama took off ice, we had lost sight of those goals. So the President 
<br>refocused our efforts there in 2009, setting the c lear goal of defeating al-Qaeda and denying it an ability to reestablish 
<br>a safe haven in Afghanistan. Because of the deteriorating security situation, he sent additional resources to reverse 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">the Taliban’s momentum and to give the Afghans the time and space to build the capacity of their security forces. We 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">have accomplished that, and now we have begun the process of bringing our troops home from Afghanistan, 
<br>including removing 33,000 by September 2012. And, with the support of our allies, the President has ou tlined a plan 
<br>to end the war in Afghanistan in 2014.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Reducing Nuclear Weapons Stockpiles.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> The Obama administration has moved away from Cold War thinking by 
<br>reducing the prominence of nuclear weapons in America’s nat ional security strategy, and it has urged others to do the 
<br>same. As long as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure, and effective arsenal to deter 
<br>any adversary and guarantee the defense of our allies. But President Obama has taken important steps to decrease 
<br>America’s nuclear arsenal and is committed to further responsible reductions. 
<br> 
<br>To reduce our warheads and stockpile, lower the threat of a nuclear exchange, and lay the foundation for future 
<br>progress, President Obama negotiated and signed the landmark New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia, 
<br>producing cuts in each side’s deployed nuclear stockpiles and launchers and allowing us to monitor and verify 
<br>Russia’s arsenal. Yet despite bipartisan consensus among former National Security Advisors, Secretaries of 
<br>Defense, and Secretaries of State that New START makes America safer, Mitt Romney strongly objected to the 
<br>treaty. Moving forward, the President will work with Russia to achieve additional reductions in stockpiles and nuclear 
<br>delivery vehicles, including tactical and non-deployed nuclear weapons. We will also work to ratify the 
<br>Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and seek a new Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty that prohibits the production of fissile 
<br>materials intended for use in nuclear weapons. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Preventing Nuclear Proliferation.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> President Obama and the Democratic Party are also committed to strengthening 
<br>the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as the bedrock of international efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons 
<br>to additional countries. As we work to uphold our obligations under the treaty by reducing stockpiles and recognizing 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">the rights of all rule-abiding states to peaceful nuclear energy, we will insist that countries without nuclear weapons 
<br>comply with their obligations not to develop them, and we will ensure that violators face real consequences.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Iran.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> President Obama, working closely with our international partners  and Congress, has put in place unprecedented 
<br>sanctions against Iran. Iran has yet to build a nuclear weapon, but has continually failed to meet its obligations under 
<br>the NPT and several United Nations Security Council resolutions, and it cannot demonstrate with any credibility that 
<br>its program is peaceful. 
<br> 
<br>The President is committed to using all instruments of national power  to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. 
<br>When President Obama took office, Iran was ascendant in the region, and the international community was divided 
<br>over how to address Iran’s nuclear violations. The President’s early offer of engagement with Iran – quickly rebuffed 
<br>by the regime – allowed the United States to expose Iranian intransigence and rally the international community as 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">never before. Working with our European allies and with Russia and China, the administration gained unprecedented 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">agreement for the toughest ever UN sanctions against Iran, laying the foundation for additiona l national financial and 
<br>energy sanctions imposed by the United States and other nations. As a result, Iran is now increasingly isolated and 
<br>the regime faces crippling economic pressure – pressure that will only build over time.

<br>he has also made clear that the window for diplomacy will not remain open indefinitely and that all options – including 
<br>military force – remain on the table. But we have an obligation to use the time and space that exists now to put 
<br>increasing pressure on the Iranian regime to live up to its obligations and rejoin the community of nations, or face the 
<br>consequences. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">North Korea.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> President Obama will also continue to confront North Korea, another regime that ignores  its 
<br>international obligations by developing nuclear weapons and missile technology, with a stark choice: take verifiable 
<br>steps toward denuclearization or face increasing isolation and costs from the United States and the international 
<br>community. That is why the administration worked with international partners to impose the harshest multilateral 
<br>sanctions on North Korea in history. And it is why the President has made clear that the transfer of nuclear weapons 
<br>or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States and 
<br>our allies, and we would hold North Korea accountable for the consequences of such action. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Securing Loose Nuclear Materials.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> The President has led a global effort to secure all loose nuclear materials 
<br>around the world, hosting a nuclear security summit in Washington, and making concrete progress in locking these 
<br>materials down. This is an important goal because the prospect that al-Qaeda or another terrorist organization might 
<br>acquire a nuclear device represents an immediate and extreme threat to global security. At the same time, the United 
<br>States will continue to work with international partners to break up black markets, detect and intercept nuclear 
<br>materials in transit, and use financial tools to disrupt this dangerous trade. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Russia.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> Crucial to achieving all of these objectives has been, and wi ll remain, expanded cooperation with Russia. 
<br>The Cold War mentality represented by Mitt Romney’s identification of Russia as “our number one geopolitical foe” 
<br>ignores the very real common interest we share with Russia in reducing nuclear stockpiles, stopping additional 
<br>proliferation by countries such as Iran and North Korea, and preventing nuclear materials from falling into the hands 
<br>of terrorists. The President’s “reset” policy toward Russia has produced significant cooperation in these areas, as wel l 
<br>as in Russian support for the Northern Distribution Network that supplies our troops in Afghanistan. We support 
<br>establishing permanent, normal trade relations with Russia because it would be good for the U.S. economy, for U.S. 
<br>businesses, and for U.S. workers if we do. And securing Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization is an 
<br>important step toward encouraging Russia to follow a rules -based system, and to protecting the rights of American 
<br>workers, farmers, ranchers, and firms. At the same time, we are candid with the Russians when we disagree. The 
<br>administration will not put aside our differences but will raise them directly with the Russian government. And we will 
<br>continue to strongly criticize Russian actions that we oppose, such as their support for the Assad regime in Syria. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:7px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,BoldItalic; font-size:7px">Countering Emerging Threats 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>As we have taken decisive steps to address today’s dangers from terrorism and to prevent  future nuclear 
<br>proliferation, we have also sought to bolster homeland security and head off emerging challenges, ranging from cyber 
<br>and biological threats to climate change and transnational crime. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Cybersecurity.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> Cybersecurity threats represent one of the most serious potential national security, public safety, and 
<br>economic challenges we face. The very technologies that empower us to lead and create also empower individual 
<br>criminal hackers, organized criminal groups, terrorist networks, and other advanced nations to disrupt the critical 
<br>infrastructure that is vital to our economy, commerce, public safety, and military. Defending against cyber threats 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">requires networks that are secure, trustworthy, and resilient. The President and the administration have taken 
<br>unprecedented steps to defend America from cyber attacks, including creating the first military command dedica ted to 
<br>cybersecurity and conducting a full review of the federal government’s efforts to protect our information and our 
<br>infrastructure. We will continue to take steps to deter, prevent, detect, and defend against cyber intrusions by 
<br>investing in cutting-edge research and development, promoting cybersecurity awareness and digital literacy, and 
<br>strengthening private sector and international partnerships . President Obama has supported comprehensive 
<br>cybersecurity legislation that would help business and government protect against risks of cyber attacks while also 
<br>safeguarding the privacy rights of our citizens. And, going forward, the President will continue to take executive action 
<br>to strengthen and update our cyber defenses.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Biological Weapons.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> Other dangers pose direct and deadly risks to our health and well-being. The use of a lethal 
<br>biological agent within a population center would threaten the l ives of hundreds of thousands of people. That’s why 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">President Obama outlined a National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats in 2009 to address the challenges 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">from proliferation of biological weapons or their use by terrorists. We will continue to work at home with first 
<br>responders and health officials to reduce the risks associated with unintentional or deliberate outbreaks of infectious 
<br>disease. We will also continue our efforts with domestic and international partners to promote global health security 
<br>and reinforce norms of safe and responsible conduct; obtain timely and accurate insight on current  and emerging

<br>perpetrators of attacks; and communicate with all stakeholders. And we wi ll build on existing public and private-sector 
<br>efforts to prevent intentional contamination of the food supply.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Climate Change</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">. The national security threat from climate change is real, urgent, and severe. The change wrought 
<br>by a warming planet will lead to new conflicts over refugees and resources; new suffering from drought and famine; 
<br>catastrophic natural disasters; and the degradation of vital ecosystems across the globe. That is why, in addition to 
<br>undertaking measures to enhance energy  independence and promote efficiency, clean energy, and renewable 
<br>sources of power here at home, the President and the Democratic Party have steadily worked to build an 
<br>international framework to combat climate change. We will seek to implement agreements and build on the progress 
<br>made during climate talks in Copenhagen, Cancun, and Durban, working to ensure a response to climate change 
<br>policy that draws upon decisive action by all nations. Our goal is an effective, internat ional effort in which all major 
<br>economies commit to reduce their emissions, nations meet their commitments in a transparent manner, and the 
<br>necessary financing is mobilized so that developing countries can mitigate the effects of climate change and invest in 
<br>clean energy technologies. That is why the Obama administration has taken a  leadership role in ongoing climate 
<br>negotiations, working to ensure that other major economies like China and India commit to taking meaningful action. 
<br>It is also why we have worked regionally to build clean energy partnerships in Asia, the Americas, and Af rica. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Transnational Crime.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> Transnational criminal networks also pose significant national security challenges. These 
<br>networks continue to expand dramatically in size and scope, harming people worldwide, posing threats to stability, 
<br>and subverting government institutions through corruption. Transnational criminal organizations have accumulated 
<br>unprecedented wealth and power through the drug trade, arms smuggling, human trafficking, and other illicit 
<br>activities, penetrating legitimate financial systems and destabilizing commercial markets. They extend their reach by 
<br>forming alliances with terrorist organizations, government officials, and some state security services. That’s why, in 
<br>2011, the Obama administration released a comprehensive Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime. We 
<br>are committed to a multidimensional approach that safeguards citizens, breaks the financial strength of criminal and 
<br>terrorist networks, disrupts illicit trafficking networks, fights government corruption, strengthens the rule of law, 
<br>bolsters judicial systems, and improves transparency. We have responded to this threat through aggressive targeting 
<br>of the illicit financial infrastructure supporting cross-border criminal activity. And we will continue to coordinate with 
<br>other nations and build their capacity to combat these threats. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:7px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,BoldItalic; font-size:7px">Strengthening Alliances, Expanding Partnerships, and Reinvigorating 
<br>International Institutions 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>The greatest dangers we face – terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cyber and biological attacks, climate change, and 
<br>transnational crime – cannot be solved by any one nation alone. Addressing these challenges requires broad and 
<br>effective global cooperation. And President Obama and the Democratic Party understand that this depends on close 
<br>collaboration with our traditional allies, cultivating partnerships with new centers of influence, and strong U.S. 
<br>leadership within international institutions. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Europe.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> The cornerstone of our engagement with the world is our alliances, which had been badly damaged under 
<br>the Bush administration. The President and the Democrat ic Party believe the foundation of global security remains 
<br>our relationships with traditional allies in Europe and Asia, and our enduring commitments to their defense. That  is 
<br>why President Obama has worked to methodically strengthen our alliances there, while pressing our allies to bear a 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">greater share of the burden for tackling regional and global challenges. 
<br> 
<br>The President and the Democratic Party recognize America’s enduring interest in supporting peace and prosperity in 
<br>Europe, as well as bolstering the strength and vitality of  NATO, which is critical to the security of the continent and 
<br>beyond. A decade of military operations  in Afghanistan has strengthened NATO’s fighting skills and enhanced its 
<br>ability to cooperate at the political level. This proved critical to the alliance’s timely, unified, and effective response in 
<br>Libya. Going forward, we need to further improve the ability of NATO countries to operate collect ively. Modernizing 
<br>the alliance will be challenging given fiscal constraints on both sides of the Atlantic. But as large-scale military 
<br>involvement in Afghanistan winds down, NATO has an opportunity to focus on further developing the capabilities 
<br>required to address 21st century challenges. Therefore, we will continue to urge our NATO allies to pool, share, and 
<br>specialize their capabilities, and to improve their capacity for effective coalition operations.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">Meanwhile, even as the presence of U.S. forces in Europe necessarily evolves, the United States will maintain its 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">Article 5 collective security commitments to NATO and will continue to leverage America’s  comparative advantage in 
<br>high-end military capabilities to ensure the defense of our allies. For example, the President is moving forward with a 
<br>“phased adaptive approach” to European ballistic-missile defense that will protect both Europe and the United States 
<br>from missile threats emanating from Iran and elsewhere. We believe that the United States and Russia can cooperate

<br>we have taken to deploy it in Poland, Turkey, and Romania.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Asia-Pacific.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> As we have sought to rebalance our foreign policy, we have also turned greater attention to 
<br>strengthening our alliances and expanding our partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region. In part, this is  in recognition 
<br>that the United States has been, and always will be, a Pacif ic power. And, in part, it is a recognition that America’s 
<br>future security and prosperity will be fundamentally interconnected with Asia given its status as the fastest growing 
<br>economic region, with most of the world’s nuclear powers and about half of the world’s population. The President has 
<br>therefore made a deliberate and strategic decision that the United States will play a larger and long-term role in 
<br>shaping this region and its future. 
<br> 
<br>President Obama has made modernizing America’s defense posture across the Asia -Pacific a top priority.  
<br>We remain committed to defending and deepening our partnerships  with our allies in the region: Australia, Japan, 
<br>New Zealand, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand. We will maintain a strong presence in Japan and on the 
<br>Korean Peninsula to deter and defend against provocations by states like North Korea, while enhancing our presence 
<br>in Southeast Asia and in Australia. We will also expand our networks of security cooperation with other emerging 
<br>partners throughout the region to combat terrorism, counter proliferation, provide disaster relief, fight piracy, and 
<br>ensure maritime security,  including cooperation in the South China Sea. And we will continue to  invest in a long-term 
<br>strategic partnership with India to support its ability to serve as a regional economic anchor and provider of security in 
<br>the broader Indian Ocean region. 
<br> 
<br>Meanwhile, the President is committed to continuing efforts to build a cooperative relationship with China, while being 
<br>clear and candid when we have differences. The world has a profound interest in the rise of a peaceful and 
<br>prosperous China, but China must also understand that it must abide by clear  international standards and rules of the 
<br>road. China can be a partner in reducing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, countering proliferation in Iran, 
<br>confronting climate change,  increasing trade, and resolving other global challenges. President Obama will continue to 
<br>seek additional opportunities for cooperation with China, including greater communication between our militaries. We 
<br>will do this even as we continue to be clear about the importance of the Chinese government upholding international 
<br>economic rules regarding currency, export financing, intellectual property, indigenous innovation, and workers’ rights. 
<br>We will consistently speak out for the importance of respecting the universal human rights of the Chinese people, 
<br>including the right of the Tibetan people to preserve their cultural and religious identity. And we remain committed to a 
<br>one China policy, the Taiwan Relations Act, and the peaceful resolution of cross</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">-</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">Strait issues that is consistent with 
<br>the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">The Middle East.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> President Obama and the Democratic Party maintain an unshakable commitment to  Israel’s 
<br>security. A strong and secure Israel is vital to the United States not simply because we share strategic interests, but 
<br>also because we share common values. For this reason, despite budgetary constraints, the President has worked 
<br>with Congress to increase security assistance to Israel every single year since taking office, providing nearly $10 
<br>billion in the past three years. The administration has also worked to ensure Israel’s qualitative military edge in the 
<br>region. And we have deepened defense cooperation – including funding the Iron Dome system – to help Israel 
<br>address its most pressing threats,  including the growing danger posed by rockets and missiles emanating from the 
<br>Gaza Strip, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran. The President’s consistent support for Israel’s right to defend itself and his 
<br>steadfast opposition to any attempt to delegitimize Israel on the world stage are further evidence of our enduring 
<br>commitment to Israel’s security. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">It is precisely because of this commitment that President Obama and  the Democratic Party seek peace between 
<br>Israelis and Palestinians. A just and lasting Israeli-Palestinian accord, producing two states for two peoples, would 
<br>contribute to regional stability and help sustain Israel’s identity as a Jewish and democratic state. At the same  time, 
<br>the President has made clear that there will be no lasting peace  unless Israel’s security concerns are met. President 
<br>Obama will continue to press Arab states to reach out to Israel. We will continue to support Israel’s peace treaties 
<br>with Egypt and Jordan, which have been pillars of peace and stability in the region for many years. And even as the 
<br>President and the Democratic Party continue to encourage all parties to be resolute in the pursuit of  peace, we will 
<br>insist that any Palestinian partner must recognize Israel’s right to exist, reject v iolence, and adhere to existing 
<br>agreements. 
<br> 
<br>Elsewhere in the region, President Obama is committed to maintaining robust security cooperation  with Gulf 
<br>Cooperation Council states and our other partners aimed at deterring aggression, checking Iran’s destabilizing 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">activities, ensuring the free flow of commerce essen tial to the global economy, and building a regional security 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">architecture to counter terrorism, proliferation, ballistic missiles, piracy, and other common threats. Jerusalem is and 
<br>will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. It 
<br>should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.

<br>hemisphere, from Canada and Mexico to Brazil and Chile and El Sa lvador. We have strengthened cooperation with 
<br>Mexico, Colombia, and throughout Central America to combat narco-traffickers and criminal gangs that threaten their 
<br>citizens and ours. We will also work to disrupt organized crime networks seeking to use the Caribbean to smuggle 
<br>drugs into our country. As we collectively confront these challenges, we will continue to support the region’s securi ty 
<br>forces, border security, and police with the equipment, training, and technologies they need to keep their communities 
<br>safe. We will improve coordination and share more information so that those who traffic in drugs and in human beings 
<br>have fewer places to hide. And we will continue to put unprecedented pressure on cartel finances, including in the 
<br>United States. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Africa.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> We will continue to partner with African nations to combat al -Qaeda affiliates in places like Somalia and to 
<br>bring to justice those who commit mass atrocities,  like Joseph Kony. We have made great efforts to reduce the 
<br>violence in Darfur and built international support for a successful referendum on South Sudan’s future. And in his first 
<br>visit as President to the United Nations, President Obama advanced initiatives to strengthen UN peacekeeping 
<br>capabilities in Africa. This includes providing equipment, training, and logistical support for UN and African Union 
<br>missions in Darfur and Somalia. The President has also worked to help African nations grow their economies, and we 
<br>have opened trade and investment opportunities across the continent. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">The United Nations</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">. International institutions – most prominently the United Nations – have been a centerpiece of 
<br>international order since the mid-20th century. And just as American leadership was essential to forging the 
<br>architecture for international cooperation after World War II, the President and the Democratic Party are committed to 
<br>modernizing its infrastructure for the 21st century – working to reform international bodies and strengthen national 
<br>and multilateral capabilities to advance peace, security, and opportunity. 
<br> 
<br>We have restored America’s leadership at the UN by cooperating with our partners there when we can and 
<br>respectfully disagreeing with them when we must, reversing the previous administration’s disdain for the UN. The 
<br>President’s leadership at the UN has enabled us to make real progress on a number of top national security priorities, 
<br>including getting Russia and China on board to implement the toughest UN sanctions ever on Iran and North Korea.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,BoldItalic; font-size:7px">Promoting Global Prosperity and Development 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>As the United States works with allies and partners to establish an international order that advances peace and 
<br>prosperity, President Obama and the Democratic Party will cont inue to build three key pillars of American global 
<br>leadership: a prosperous and inclusive economy, our unsurpassed military strength, and an enduring commitment to 
<br>advancing universal values. 
<br> 
<br>To allow each American to pursue the opportunity upon which our prosperity depends, we are investing  in the 
<br>sources of our long-term economic strength: access to a complete and competitive education for every American; 
<br>affordable health care so our people, businesses, and government are not constrained by rising costs; training to 
<br>allow our workers to adapt and win in a rapidly changing global economy; transformations in the way we produce and 
<br>use energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and create new jobs and industry; infrastructure that fuels 
<br>commerce; cutting edge developments in science and innovation that support our economy, defense, and 
<br>technological leadership; and making the hard decisions to cut our deficit and put our fiscal house in order.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">And, because a growing and open global economy serves as a source of opportunity for the American people and a 
<br>source of strength for the United States, the President and the Democratic Party have coordinated our economic 
<br>actions with other countries to address financ ial crises and head off renewed cycles of boom and bust. We have 
<br>reformed international institutions to give emerging economies a greater role and more responsibility. We have 
<br>promoted trade that is free and fair. And we have supported global economic development. 
<br> 
<br>Abroad, just as we have at home, we have sought to build a new model for 21st century economic growth that is fair 
<br>and in which every nation plays by the rules – a model where workers’ rights are respected, businesses compete on 
<br>a level playing field, and intellectual property and new technologies are protected. Currencies must be market-driven 
<br>so no nation has an unfair advantage. Reforms must protect consumers from abuse and reflect a global commitment 
<br>to end corruption. And we will continue to champion sustainable growth that includes the clean energy that creates 
<br>green jobs and combats climate change.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Addressing the Global Financial Crisis. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> Alongside our global partners, we took decisive actions to address the 
<br>global financial crisis and have worked together to make the global economy and financial system more stable and 
<br>secure. While Europe remains a significant risk to the global economy and while the problems there will not be solved 
<br>overnight, Europe’s leaders have made clear they will do what is necessary to preserve financial stability in the

<br>in frequent contact with our European allies to discuss best practices and share valuable lessons from our own 
<br>experience reversing our economic downturn, helping them chart the best way forward. 
<br> 
<br>As we continue to work with traditional centers of influence, we have also reached out to emerging economies to give 
<br>them a greater voice and a greater stake in the g lobal economy. We have made the G-20 the premier forum for 
<br>international economic coordination in recognition of the fact that 21st century economic discussions must include 
<br>countries like China, India, Indonesia, and Brazil. And, together, the nations of the G-20 brought the world economy 
<br>back from the brink of another depression.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Free and Fair Trade.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> We have also sought to promote free and fair trade. Because of the economic dynamism of the 
<br>Asia-Pacific region, which is already home to more than half the global economy, expanding trade with that region is 
<br>critical to creating jobs and opportunities for the American people. Building on the free trade agreement with South 
<br>Korea that President Obama signed, we are working with our partners in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
<br>Forum to create a seamless regional economy, promote green growth, and coordinate regulatory reform. Alongside 
<br>Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam, we are on track to 
<br>finalize the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a historic high-standard agreement that will address new and emerging trade 
<br>issues, lower barriers to the free flow of trade and investment, increase exports, and create more American jobs. 
<br>Exploring opportunities to shape the multilateral trading system to reflect the role and responsibility of major emerging 
<br>markets in the global economy is a critica l part of the President’s trade agenda. 
<br> 
<br>We will work to expand free and fair trade in the Americas as well. We  already export more than three times as much 
<br>to Latin America as we do to China, and we will pursue additional opportunities to expand commerce and promote 
<br>shared prosperity. Last year the President signed free trade agreements with Panama and Colombia – agreements 
<br>that will significantly boost U.S. exports and support thousands of jobs here at home – while protecting labor rights, 
<br>the environment, and intellectual property. Because the Caribbean is an important region to our country, we will 
<br>continue to support robust trade and economic relationships with our partners there. And, across the region , we are 
<br>moving ahead with “open skies” agreements to expand opportun ities for commercial aviation and to bring our people 
<br>and businesses closer together. 
<br> 
<br>We have also worked to ensure that American businesses and workers are competing on an even footing with our 
<br>international competitors, and we have not hesitated to take action. That’s why the Obama administration has brought 
<br>trade cases against China at twice the rate of the previous administration and recently set up a new Interagency 
<br>Trade Enforcement Center, which substantially expands our ability to investigate and take action against unfair trade 
<br>practices around the world. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Advancing Global Development.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> President Obama recognizes that promoting global development is a strategic, 
<br>economic, and moral imperative for the United States. Development expands markets for American products and 
<br>creates American jobs. Strong and prosperous regional partners are critical to addressing global challenges, ending 
<br>regional conflicts, and countering the spread of global criminal networks. And good governance and stability cannot 
<br>take root, and basic human dignity cannot be protected, where poverty reigns and people lack access to the food, 
<br>basic education, clean water, and medicine they need to survive. 
<br> 
<br>For these reasons, the President this year announced a new strategy toward sub-Saharan Africa that commits to 
<br>promoting economic growth, including through increased trade and investment. They are also why we are providing 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">robust trade and investment support to Africa and building a trade and investment partnership with the countries of 
<br>East Africa – because we believe that the private sector will be the engine of prosperity in the developing world. The 
<br>administration continues to work to promote opportunity and development in sub-Saharan Africa by improving the 
<br>region’s trade competitiveness, encouraging economic diversification, and ensuring that the benefits from growth are 
<br>broad-based. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Combating HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">. Recognizing that health is a prerequisite  for development, the 
<br>President has made unprecedented progress  in the global fight against HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. 
<br>Building on the strong foundation created during the previous administration, the President’s Emergency Plan for 
<br>AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has expanded its prevention, care, and treatment programming. As a result, PEPFAR now 
<br>has made significant investments in more than 30 countries, and we set a goal to roughly double the number of 
<br>lifesaving anti-retroviral treatments we provide by the end of 2013. W ith his latest budget, the President is fulf illing his 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">historic commitment to request $4 billion over three years for the Global Fund, and the President remains committed 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">to robust funding for PEPFAR and the Global Fund in the future. And President Obama lifted the 25-year ban that 
<br>prevented non-citizens living with HIV from entering the United States, allowing the world’s largest group of HIV/AIDS 
<br>researchers, policymakers, medical professionals, and advocates to convene in Washington to continue their efforts 
<br>to improve prevention and treatment.

<br>Our efforts to combat HIV/AIDS are part of a broader commitment to address the challenges posed by  infectious 
<br>disease. Over the past four years, the administration has leveraged billions of dollars in commitments from donors to 
<br>meet the demand for new vaccines, making it possible to immunize millions of children and prevent premature 
<br>deaths. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Ensuring Food Security.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> The President and the Democratic Party believe that true development requires much 
<br>more than delivering aid – it requires building the capacity of governments and peoples so that assistance is no 
<br>longer needed. That is why the administrat ion through its Feed the Future  initiative has, with the G-8 and other 
<br>countries, mobilized more than $22 billion for a global food security effort aimed at building the capacity of nations to 
<br>feed themselves. This year, the President  launched the next phase of this global effort – a major new food security 
<br>partnership to reduce hunger and lift tens of millions of people from poverty across Africa. These efforts  partner with 
<br>African countries to improve nutrition for children, mitigate risks from volatile food prices, increase private capital 
<br>investments, expand access to technologies and information required to boost food production, and provide greater 
<br>assistance to countries that implement agricultural reforms. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Responding to Humanitar ian Crises</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">. Together with the American people and the international community, we will 
<br>continue to respond to humanitarian crises around the globe. We will come to the aid of countries during their times of 
<br>need, just as we did following the 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. And as we 
<br>did in the aftermath of Haiti’s catastrophic earthquake in January 2010, we will provide critical aid to countries facing 
<br>devastating circumstances to meet their acute short-term needs and foster long-term recovery. The President led an 
<br>unprecedented international effort in response to Haiti’s natural disaster, committing over $3.1 billion  to relief, 
<br>reconstruction, and recovery, and launching a multifaceted effort to improve health, promote food security, and 
<br>strengthen economic security. While major challenges remain, President Obama has supported a sustained 
<br>commitment to Haiti’s reconstruction, and the administration has continued to assist in Haiti’s development. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:7px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,BoldItalic; font-size:7px">Maintaining the Strongest Military in the World 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>America’s unrivaled military capabilities represent a second core pillar of our global leadership. After more than a 
<br>decade of war, we have an opportunity to retool our armed forces and our defense strategy to ensure we both 
<br>maintain the world’s most capable military and adapt to the challenges of the 21st century.  
<br> 
<br>The President and the Democratic Party understand that we have a special obligation to every soldier, sailor, airman, 
<br>Marine, and Coast Guardsman who puts their life on the line for our nation. We must send them into harm’s way only 
<br>when it’s absolutely necessary. When we do, we must ensure they have the equipment and the support that they 
<br>need to get the job done. And we have to take care of our  troops, their families, and our veterans when they come 
<br>home. 
<br> 
<br>Eleven years of continuous military operations and repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan have stretched our 
<br>forces and strained their families. Going forward, our troops will face fewer deployments,  allowing them more time to 
<br>train and ensuring that they are ready for the full range of missions they may have to face. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">In our current fiscal environment, we must also make tough budgetary decisions across the board – and that includes 
<br>within the defense budget. The Budget Control Act enac ted by Congress last year, with the support of Republicans 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">and Democrats alike, mandates reductions in federal spending, including defense spending. The administration has 
<br>worked with Congress to make these decisions, which has been a strategy-driven process. As we look beyond the 
<br>wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – and the conclusion of long-term nation-building with large military footprints – we will 
<br>be able to ensure our security with a more agile and more flexible force. At the same time, we will continue to 
<br>emphasize forward engagement in critical regions, while enhancing robust security partnerships to share the burden. 
<br>And we will continue to get rid of outdated Cold War-era systems so that we can invest in cutting-edge technologies 
<br>and maintain a versatile set of capabilities required to execute a wide range of military missions. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Italic; font-size:7px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,BoldItalic; font-size:7px">Advancing Universal Values 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br>America’s leadership extends beyond our economic prosperity and military might – it is also rooted in our enduring 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">commitment to advancing a core set of universal values . These include an individual’s freedom to speak their mind, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">assemble without fear, have access to information, worship as they please, and choose their own leaders. They also 
<br>include dignity, tolerance, and equality among all people, and the fair and equitable administration of justice. The 
<br>United States was founded upon a belief in these values, and people of every race, region, and religion around the 
<br>globe have claimed these principles as their own. The President and the Democratic Party believe that nations that

<br>than those that do not. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Staying True to Our Values at Home.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> We must always seek to uphold these values at home, not just when it is 
<br>easy, but, more importantly, when it is hard. Advancing our interests may involve new actions and policies to confront 
<br>threats like terrorism, but the President and the Democratic Party believe these practices must always be in line with 
<br>our Constitution, preserve our people’s privacy and civil liberties, and withstand the checks and balances that have 
<br>served us so well. That is why the President banned torture without exception in his first week in office. That is why 
<br>we are reforming military commissions to bring them in line with the rule of law. That is why we are substantially 
<br>reducing the population at Guantánamo Bay without adding to it. And we remain committed to working with all 
<br>branches of government to close the prison altogether because it is inconsistent with our national security interests 
<br>and our values. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Standing With Those Demanding Greater Freedom</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">. As we continue to perfect our union here at home, setting an 
<br>example for others to follow, we will also continue to champion universal rights abroad. We recognize that different 
<br>cultures and traditions give life to these values  in distinct ways, and each country will inevitably chart its own course. 
<br>America will not impose any system of government on another country. But we also know that the sovereignty of 
<br>nations cannot strangle the liberty of individuals. So as people around the world yearn for greater freedom, we will 
<br>continue to support progress toward more accountable, democratic governance and the exercise of universal rights. 
<br>We will do so through a variety of means: by speaking out for universal rights, bolstering fragile  democracies and civil 
<br>society, and supporting the dignity that comes with development. 
<br> 
<br>Across the Middle East and North Africa, we have stood with the people demanding political change and seeking 
<br>their rights during the Arab Spring. Since the beginning of the protests in Tunisia, the United States has consistently 
<br>opposed violence against innocent civilians, supported a set of universal rights for the people of the region, and 
<br>supported processes of political and economic reform. When the Egyptian people  flooded Tahrir Square in Cairo 
<br>demanding democracy, the administration actively engaged the Egyptian government, military, and people in support 
<br>of a transition away from decades of dictatorship and towards democracy. In Libya, we built an international c oalition 
<br>and intervened alongside NATO and other partner nations to protect the Libyan people and support them as they 
<br>ended Muammar Qadhafi’s brutal reign. In Iran, President Obama spoke out in support of the prodemocracy 
<br>protestors and imposed human rights sanctions on the Iranian government. In Yemen, we worked with Gulf 
<br>Cooperation Council states to facilitate a peaceful transition of power. And in Syria, we have led the international 
<br>community to politically and economically isolate the regime, to increase pressure on President Assad to step down, 
<br>and to provide assistance to unify the Syrian opposition in order to enable a stable transition. Moving forward, we will 
<br>work to hasten the end of the Assad regime and support a political transition to a stable and democratic Syria. We will 
<br>continue to support the consolidation of democratic transitions in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Yemen. And we will 
<br>engage governments and civil society across the region on behalf of genuine efforts to promote political and 
<br>economic reforms that are responsive to the people of the region. 
<br> 
<br>The Arab Spring represents the world’s most sweeping recent movement toward democracy, but it is not an isolated 
<br>case. Across the globe, people are demanding more from their governments – and, when they do, they will continue 
<br>to find support and partnership in the United States. For example, in Burma, we successfully employed a combination 
<br>of sanctions and engagement to encourage the government to open up political space and release political  prisoners. 
<br>Our historic opening to Burma will continue to incentivize a democratic transition, a deeper engagement with the 
<br>United States, and national reconciliation among Burma’s many different ethnic groups. And because human rights 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">violations persist, we will continue to speak clearly about the additional steps that must be taken for the government 
<br>of Burma to have a better relationship with the United States. 
<br> 
<br>In Africa, the administration engaged to ensure a legitimate transfer of power in Cote d’Ivoi re, supported the 
<br>independence of South Sudan, and remains actively involved in resolving the issues between Sudan and South 
<br>Sudan. 
<br> 
<br>In the Americas, we see vibrant democracies in countries from Mexico to Brazil and Costa Rica to Chile. We have 
<br>also seen historic peaceful transfers of power in places like El Salvador and Uruguay. Yet despite the region’s 
<br>democratic progress, stark inequalities in political and economic power endure. We will continue to press for more 
<br>transparent and accountable governance. And we will promote greater freedom in Cuba and Venezuela until all their 
<br>citizens enjoy the universal rights they deserve. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">Under President Obama, we have undertaken the most significant efforts in decades to engage the Cuban people. 
<br>We have focused on the importance of the family ties between Cuban Americans and their relatives still living under 
<br>oppression. Because of steps the President has taken, it is now possible for Cuban Americans to visit and support 
<br>their families in Cuba, and to send remittances  that reduce the Cuban people’s dependence on the Cuban state. We

<br>religious groups on the island and enhancing the free flow of information  to, from, and among the Cuban people. 
<br>Going forward we will continue to support the Cuban people’s desire to freely determine their own future.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Promoting Transparent, Accountable Governance and the Rule of Law. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> To promote transparent and 
<br>accountable government worldwide, we joined with Brazil to launch and co-chair the international Open Government 
<br>Partnership. Fifty-five countries now belong to the partnership – representing a quarter of the world’s people – each 
<br>of which has outlined concrete, credible steps to open the work of government so citizens are empowered, problems 
<br>are solved, and democracy is strengthened. 
<br> 
<br>The President and Democrats know that a commitment to the rule of law and effective judicial institutions are 
<br>essential to sustainable economic development and must remain a core American value in the years to come. That is 
<br>why the Obama administration has successfully pressed for international action against government corruption 
<br>through the G-20 and promoted new initiatives to help countries  develop stronger judicial institutions. Because the 
<br>public’s rights, freedoms, and access to economic opportunity depend on the rule of law, we will continue to work in 
<br>partnership with our allies to promote this important value around the world. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Standing up for Women’s Rights Around the Globe</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">. As we work to advance universal values and human dignity, 
<br>the President and the Democratic Party understand the critical importance of expanding protections and opportunities 
<br>for women and girls around the world. Ensuring full equality and providing women and girls the opportunity to learn, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">earn a livable wage, and participate in public decision-making are essential to reduce violence, improve economies, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">and strengthen democracy. To continue to make progress at home and advance women’s rights and opportunities 
<br>abroad, we will urge ratification of the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.  
<br> 
<br>President Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the State Department  are committed to advancing 
<br>the rights of women and girls as a central focus of U.S. diplomatic, development, and defense interests. We will 
<br>continue to promote the full engagement of women in the political and economic spheres. We will work to address 
<br>underlying socio-economic problems, including women’s access to health, education, and food security. And we will 
<br>ensure that women are equal participants in reconciliation and development in areas affected by conflict.  
<br> 
<br>President Obama and the Democratic Party are committed to supporting family planning around the globe to help 
<br>women care for their families, support their communities, and lead their countries to be healthier and more 
<br>productive. That’s why, in his first month in office, President Obama overtu rned the “global gag rule,” a ban on federal 
<br>funds to foreign family planning organizations that provided information about, counseling on, or offered abortions. 
<br>And that is why the administration has supported lifesaving family planning health information and services. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Combating Human Trafficking.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> Some 27 million women, men, and children around the world are victims of human 
<br>trafficking. The President and the Democratic Party believe that trafficking in persons is both an affront to our 
<br>fundamental values and, as a source of funds for transnational criminals and terrorist organization, a threat to 
<br>national and international security. The Obama administration has used bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, targeted 
<br>foreign assistance, training programs, public outreach, and law enforcement to combat trafficking in persons across 
<br>the globe. The administration has continued to provide annual assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of 
<br>foreign governments’ efforts to address the issue, encouraging all countries to do more and calling out countries that 
<br>have failed to do enough. And the administration has provided technical assistance to improve law enforcement and 
<br>grants to support grassroots prevention efforts around the world targeting sex and labor traffick ing, child sex tourism, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">forced child labor, and other abuses. The administration is also committed to taking action at home to fight trafficking, 
<br>including the sex trafficking of young girls. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Gay Rights as Human Rights.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px"> Recognizing that gay rights are human rights, the President and his administration 
<br>have vowed to actively combat efforts by other nations that criminalize homosexual conduct or ignore abuse. Under 
<br>the Obama administration, American diplomats must raise the issue wherever harassment or abuse  arises, and they 
<br>are required to record it in the State Department’s annual report on human rights. And the State Department is 
<br>funding a program that finances gay rights organizations to combat discrimination, violence, and other abuses.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Bold; font-size:5px">Internet Freedom. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">The Obama administration has led the world to recognize and defend Internet freedom – the 
<br>freedom of expression, assembly, and association online for people everywhere – through coalitions of countries and 
<br>by empowering individuals with innovative technologies. The administration has built partnerships to support an 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">Internet that is secure and reliable and that is respectful of U.S. intellectual property, free flow of information, and 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">privacy. To preserve the Internet as a platform for commerce, debate,  learning, and innovation in the 21st century, we 
<br>successfully negotiated international Internet policymaking principles, support the current multi-stakeholder approach 
<br>to Internet governance, and oppose the extension of intergovernmental controls over the  Internet.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:5px">The United States continues to move forward towards a future of strong and sustained growth. Thanks to the 
<br>leadership of President Obama and Democrats around the country, we’re  fighting back from the deepest economic 
<br>crisis since the Great Depression by making investments to create jobs, grow the middle class, and lay the 
<br>foundations for an economy that out-educates, out-builds, and out-innovates the rest of the world. Today, America is 
<br>both stronger and safer than it was four years ago. Now, we must continue the work we’ve started so that the United 
<br>States of America never fails to meet the tests of our time.
